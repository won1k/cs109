                 of our project.
    
                         1.   Your script is numbered and is for your use alone.
    
                         2.   In addition to your script number in each page, all
                              scripts have been coded (by number) by a method
                              known only to this office.
    
                 Reproduction of all or part of these materials will 
                 be traceable.
    
                 Needless to say, if you have this script, you are a colleague
                 in our mutual endeavor. Please take care of your material and

                 It has come to my attention that unauthorized copies of the
                 STAR TREK VI script have been made and distributed.
    
                 Requests for copies of the script should only be made through
                 my office (956-5797)
    
                 Each script has been assigned both a number and an
                 internal code, which allows us to trace the script even if
                 the red number written on each page is somehow removed.
    
                 A wide distribution of the script weakens the impact that
                 STAR TREK can have at the box office.
    
                 Please return your script to my office if it is not essential to 
                 the making of this film. Please understand that this is necessary
                 to help us deliver a fresh movie to our dedicated audience.
    
                 Please help us maintain the secrecy of our project.
                 Thank you for your help and cooperation.

                                 simple as I possibly can. The
                                 Klingon empire has roughly 50 
                                 years of life left to it.
    
                       They look at each other in disbelief.

                                 Two months ago a Federation
                                 Starship monitored an explosion on
                                 the Klingon moon Praxis. We
                                 believe it was caused by over mining
                                 and insufficient safety precautions.
                                 The moon's decimation means an
                                 almost eighty percent loss of
                                 available energy and a deadly
                                 pollution of their ozone. Due to
                                 their large military expenditures,
                                 the Klingon economy is in a very
                                 weakened condition. They do not
                                 have sufficient resources to
                                 manufacture air shelters in large
                                 enough quantities to sustain
                                 anything like their current
                                 population. Last month - at the
                                 behest of the, uh, Vulcan
                                 Ambassador - I opened a dialogue
                                 with Gorkon, Chancellor of the
                                 Klingon High Council. He proposes
                                 to commence negotiations at once.

                                 Neutral Zone, an end to seventy
                                 years of unremitting hostility - a
                                 hostility the Klingons can no
                                 longer afford.

                                 If the Klingons sue for peace, we
                                 could accumulate savings in defense
                                 expenditures, leaving the
                                 Federation economy free to grapple
                                 with urgent social problems...

                                 I'm sure our exploration and
                                 science programs would not be
                                 affected, but the facts speak for
                                 themselves, Captain.
    
                                               ADMIRAL DONALD
                                 I must protest. To offer the
                                 Klingons a safe haven within
                                 Federation space is suicide.
                                 Klingons would become the alien
                                 trash of the galaxy. And if we
                                 dismantle the fleet, we'd be
                                 defenseless before a bellicose
                                 people with a foothold on our
                                 territory. The opportunity which
                                 presents itself here is to embargo
                                 trading, force them to run through
                                 their own resources faster, and
                                 bring them to their knees. Then
                                 we'll be in a far better position
                                 to dictate terms.
    
                       A vocal minority of the briefing supports this, but not
                       all. Kirk simply stares at Spock.

                                 Klingons have never been 
                                 trustworthy. I'm forced to agree
                                 with Admiral Donald. This is -

                                 I'm sorry. But Commander Spock has
                                 persuaded the Federation that this
                                 situation is too promising to
                                 ignore.

                                 Captain Kirk, you are to be our

                                 We have volunteered to rendezvous
                                 with the Klingon ship that's
                                 bringing Chancellor Gorkon here,
                                 and escort him safely through

                                 As it happens, Kirk, the Chancellor
                                 specifically requested you and your
                                 officers.

                                 There are some Klingons who feel
                                 the same about the peace treaty as
                                 yourself and Admiral Donald.
                                 They'll think twice about attacking

                       bright red. Gorkon is dead. Kirk is in shock: he was
                       for real.
    
                       Azetbur sits holding Gorkon, dry-eyed.
    
                       Kirk has to pull the stunned Bones away.

                                 Law, I place you both under arrest.
                                 You are charged with assassinating
                                 the Chancellor of the High Council.
    
                                               KIRK
                                 He just tried to save him!

                                 Take them away.
    
                       They are handcuffed. Both are in shock.

                       Uhura is listening carefully. Scotty has joined Spock
                       and the others on the bridge.
    
                                               UHURA
                                 They've been arrested.
    
                       All eyes go to Spock. We can guess how he feels.
    
                                               CHEKOV
                                 Mr. Spock, we've got to do
                                 something!
    
                       The others crowd in, waiting for orders. Depending on
                       him.

                                 I assume command of this ship as of
                                         (he checks)
                                 0130 hours. Uhura, send to
                                 Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely
                                 what has taken place, and request
                                 instructions.

                                 But we can't allow them to be taken
                                 back to Kronos as prisoners.
    
                                               SPOCK
                                 What do you suggest, Lieutenant?
                                 Opening fire won't retrieve the
                                 Captain; and an armed engagement
                                 was precisely what he wished to
                                 avoid.

                                 At least we must keep track of
                                 where they are taken, sir. I -
    
                                               SPOCK
                                 I've already addressed that
                                 question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able
                                 to follow the Captain's movements.

                                 How did you - ?
    
                                               SPOCK
                                 In the meantime we must endeavor to
                                 piece together what happened here
                                 tonight. According to our data
                                 banks, this ship fired those
                                 torpedoes.
    
                                               SCOTTY
                                 NO WAY!
    
                                               SPOCK
                                 Mr. Scott, you forget yourself.
                                 Please accompany me.
    
                       He starts out -
    
                                               CHEKOV
                                 And if we can't piece together what
                                 happened? What then? Sir.
    
                       Spock turns unhappily.
    
                                               SPOCK
                                 Then Mr. Chekov, it resides in the
                                 hands of the diplomats.
    
                  63   INT. OFFICE OF THE FEDERATION PRESIDENT - DAY                 63
    
                       The FEDERATION PRESIDENT and the KLINGON AMBASSADOR.
                       With them is the VULCAN AMBASSADOR, SAREK - Spock's
                       father - and NANCLUS, the ROMULAN AMBASSADOR.
    
                                               KLINGON AMBASSADOR
                                 The Chancellor of the High Council
                                 is dead - the result of an
                                 unprovoked attack while he
                                 traveled to see YOU under a flag
                                 of truce on a mission of peace.
                                 Captain Kirk was legally arrested
                                 for the crime. May I remind you
                                 that he and Doctor McCoy boarded
                                 KRONOS ONE of their own free will.
                                 None of these facts are in dispute,
                                 Mr. President.
    
                                               PRESIDENT
                                 I will demand a full investigation.
                                 You can be assured we will
                                 cooperate with all our power to get
                                 to the bottom of the matter. In
                                 the meantime --
    
                                               KLINGON AMBASSADOR
                                 In the meantime we expect the
                                 Federation to abide by the articles
                                 of Interstellar Law you claim to
                                 cherish. Kirk and Doctor McCoy
                                 WILL stand trial for the
                                 assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.
    
                                               PRESIDENT
                                 Out of the question. Ambassador
                                 Sarek, there must be some way to
                                 extradite these men - 
    
                                               AMBASSADOR SAREK
                                         (heavily)
                                 Mr. President, I share a measure of
                                 personal responsibility in this
                                 matter, but I am obliged to confirm
                                 my esteemed colleagues legal
                                 interpretation: Kirk and Dr. McCoy
                                 were properly arrested, and the
                                 Klingons are within their rights to
                                 try them.
    
                                               PRESIDENT
                                 And what is the position of the
                                 Romulan government, Ambassador
                                 Nanclus?
    
                                               AMBASSADORT NANCLUS
                                         (wily)
                                 In the absence of specific
                                 instructions from my government, I
                                 must concur with my colleagues.
    
                                               PRESIDENT
                                 But surely you cannot believe that
                                 James Kirk assassinated the
                                 Chancellor of the High Council.
    
                                               AMBASSADOR NANCLUS
                                         ("reluctant")
                                 Mr. President, I don't know what to
                                 believe.
    
                                               KLINGON AMBASSADOR
                                 I am waiting for your answer, Mr.
                                 President.
    
                       Long pause.
    
                                               PRESIDENT
                                 This President is not above the
                                 law.
    
                       The Klingon Ambassador bows and takes his leave.
    
                       The President is left with the two Ambassadors.

                                 Send them in.
    
                       Three OFFICERS from Starfleet - including Admiral
                       Donald and the CinC - enter from a DIFFERENT DOOR.

                                 Mr. President we cannot allow
                                 Federation citizens to be abducted.
    
                                               PRESIDENT
                                 At present I'm awaiting a full
                                 report from Enterprise. Pending
                                 that I am constrained to observe
                                 Interstellar Law.
    
                       A stand off. Donald nods to another OFFICER.
    
                                               OFFICER
                                 I've prepared Operation Retrieve
                                 based on the rising danger of
                                 terrorism and hostility between the
                                 Klingon empire and the Federation.
                                         (hands the President a CD)
                                 Put simply, we can go in and rescue
                                 the Starfleet hostages and be out
                                 in 24 hours with an acceptable rate
                                 of loss in manpower and equipment.
                                 We have the technology --

                                 Suppose you precipitate a full
                                 scale war?
    
                                               OFFICER
                                 Then, quite frankly, Mr. President
                                 we can clean their chronometers.
    
                                               AMBASSADOR NANCLUS
                                 Mr. President, they ARE vulnerable.
                                 There'll never be a better time...

                                 I'd prefer not to be the President
                                 to push the button if I can avoid
                                 it.

                                 accessible the hostages will be,
                                 Mr. President.
    
                                               PRESIDENT
                                 I'll bear it in mind, Admiral. I
                                 think that's all.

                                 Those men have literally saved this
                                 planet - and you know it.
    
                                               PRESIDENT
                                 I do know it. And I'm afraid
                                 they're going to save it again. By
                                 standing trial.
    
                       They're dismissed. The President puts his head in his
                       hands...finally looks up at Sarek.
    
                                               PRESIDENT
                                 Do you know I agree with everything
                                 they said?
    
                                               AMBASSADOR SAREK
                                 I'm sorry, Mr. President. And I
                                 know my son must feel equally
                                 responsible. It was at my request
                                 that he persuaded Kirk to undertake
                                 this mission.
    
                       The President looks at him.
    
                                               PRESIDENT

                                 back here before the end of the

                                 You have our total support, Mister
                                 President. My factories are
                                 standing by. We can gear up to

                                 Thank you, Henry. Right now we're
                                 pursuing diplomatic channels...

                                 If I may, Mr. President. The
                                 important thing is to keep the
                                 peace process alive. If the new
                                 Chancellor is so disposed, perhaps
                                 we can attach a rider, get some
                                 assurance that these men won't be
                                 executed. Then, in a year -

                                 calling.

                                 Madam Chancellor, you have my
                                 sincerest condolences on your
                                 recent loss. I want to assure you
                                 that this shameful deed --
    
                                               AZETBUR
                                 Mr. President, let us come to the
                                 point: you want the conference to
                                 go forward and so did my father. I
                                 will attend in one week - after
                                 I've had the opportunity to master
                                 the details of this position - on
                                 one condition: we will not
                                 extradite the prisoners and you
                                 will not attempt to rescue them in
                                 a military operation. We would
                                 consider any such attempt an act 
                                 of war.
    
                                               PRESIDENT
                                 We look forward to meeting with you
                                 next week, Madam Chancellor. I hope
                                 you will be our guest here on --

                                 After recent events you will
                                 understand I prefer a neutral site.
                                 And in the interests of security,
                                 let us keep the location secret.

                                 With the greatest pleasure, Madam

                       Spock and Scotty hover over the torpedo console,
                       looking at numbers and lights. Spock thinks hard.
                       EIGHT BELLS SOUND. It is perfectly clear: according to
                       the "INVENTORY" program ALL TORPEDOES ARE STILLL ABOARD.
    
                                               SCOTTY
                                 It's as I said, Mr. Spock:
                                 Inventory still registers every
                                 torpedo.

                                 Yet the data banks insist we fired:
                                 twice. One computer is lying.
    
                                               SCOTTY
                                 A computer canna lie, sir.
    
                                               SPOCK
                                 I think  not.
    
                                               SCOTTY
                                 You can check the torpedoes
                                 visually, if you like -
    
                                               SPOCK
                                 We'll have to check every one of
                                 them, Mr. Scott.
    
                                               SCOTTY
                                 That could take hours!
    
                                               SPOCK
                                 Nevertheless.

                                 Then someone forged a data bank
                                 entry.
    
                       Lieutenant Saavik descends into the bay.

                                 They've named Gorkon's daughter
                                 Chancellor - it was on the news.
    
                                               SCOTTY
                                 I'll bet that Klingon bitch killed
                                 her father...

                                 They don't place the same value on
                                 life that we do, Spock - you know
                                 that... take my word: she didn't
                                 shed one bloody tear...
    
                                               SPOCK
                                 That's hardly conclusive, Mr.
                                 Scott, as Klingons have no tear
                                 ducts.

                       A cavernous stadium arranged in circular tiers cut from
                       jagged stone. A place from a bygone age, of savage and
                       awesome beauty. Something between a CIRCUS and a
                       CATHEDRAL.
    
                       ... turned for the occasion into a gigantic COURTROOM
                       with thousands of spectators... SCREAMING: "KIRK! KIRK!
                       KIRK!
    
                       Many in the AUDIENCE hold SPEARS with lighted HEADS.
    
                       Kirk and Bones in the dock, stand in the bottom at the
                       very center of the circle, surrounded by a Klingon
                       AUDIENCE in rising tiers, while HOODED KLINGON JUDGES
                       sit invisible in a darkened dugout. (One Judge is an
                       ALBINO.)
    
                       CHANG wears the prosecutor's mantle.
    
                       In the audience is President Azetbur and her ADVISORS.
                       The trial is being BROADCAST and special CAMERAS
                       abound.
    
                       Near Kirk and Bones sit their young, eager Klingon
                       DEFENSE ATTORNEY. Kirk keeps his cool throughout,
                       though Bones tends to steam.
    
                       The rules are different. Attorneys are empowered to
                       ask anyone present a question at any time. And to mix
                       this up with statements and charges.
    
                       The proceedings BEGIN in subtitled KLINGON. Kirk and
                       Bones wear HEADPHONES. When they speak a TRANSLATOR
                       converts to Klingon...
    
                       As Chang gets going, we ZOOM into his MOUTH and he
                       converts to ENGLISH... the JUDGES' GAVEL IS A GROTESQUE

                                 provocation, the Chancellor and his
                                 advisers having been lulled into a
                                 false sense of security with an

                                 that same evening.
                                 Do you deny all this?
    
                       The mob howls "Kirk!" as the Judge gavels.

                                 After the first hit, we lost our
                                 gravitational field; I found myself
                                 weightless and unable to function.
                                 Then 2 Starfleet crewmen came
                                 walking toward us -

                                 to say, but has it occurred to... to
                                 any of us... that the Captain is...
                                 that is, we know his feelings about

                       FIFTEEN PRISONERS in leg irons and FIVE KLINGON GUARDS
                       with JACKAL-MASTIFFS moving slowly across the frigid

                       Kirk and Bones, likewise shackled, are among them.
                       GUARDS and PRISONERS alike wear ragged furs.
    
                       They reach a lone TOTEM and a GUARD holds up his hand
                       for a halt. He presses an instrument emitting a high-
                       pitched WHINE.
    
                       In response, A HUGE TRAP DOOR, buried in the snow,
                       yawns open. A KLINGON GUARD emerges from steps below
                       and places a BOX before the gaping DOOR.

                       and his JACKAL MASTIFF emerge. He mounts the box.

                                 This is Rura Penthe. Observe:
                                 there is no stockade, no guard
                                 tower, no electrified frontier.
                                 They are not needed. Only a
                                 magnetic shield prevents beaming.

                       He blows a mechanical WHISTLE: in response, TWO GUARDS
                       emerge from below with a SCREAMING KLINGON CONVICT.
    
                                               PRISONER

                                 nothing can survive.
    
                       The GUARDS dump the screaming CONVICT on the ice - 
                       without furs. The weather immobilizes him at once -
                       his cries become fainter.

                       He leaves; the box is removed by a guard and proceeds
                       him through the huge door and down the steps.

                       the frozen corpse of the CONVICT is left - until it too

                       START LOOKING UP AT THE CLOSING TRAP DOOR - outside we
                       can see SNOW flurries as the panel shuts with a CLANG.

                       A huge underground labyrinth with an enormous courtyard
                       surrounded by prisoner huts open to the center.
                       PRISONERS wander freely within. The scum of the
                       universe.
    
                       Everyone wears furs, LEG IRONS and is FREEZING.
    
                       On endless scaffolding above, the GUARDS.
    
                       Many of the PRISONERS look like they could snap Kirk
                       and Bones in two with one hand.
    
                       Kirk and Bones step gingerly around the outside wall,
                       watching the yard. A shadow falls across them.

                       Kirk gets hit in the face. It's already BLOODY. It's
                       a prison fight. Kirk and an ALIEN are surrounded by
                       PRISONERS & GUARDS cheering and jeering.
    
                       Kirk and Bones are distinctly grubbier.
    
                       Kirk scrambles to his feet and circles. The Alien
                       swings a large paw but Kirk ducks, comes in with an
                       uppercut. He connects, but does little damage. They
                       circle some more. The Alien dives legs first and
                       scissors Kirk, who goes down roughly. Wrestling, Kirk
                       slips free.
    
                       Bones and Martia watch... the leg irons make it
                       complicated - they can also wrap around someone's
                       neck...
    
                       The Alien moves in closely, hits Kirk again. Kirk
                       fights back with a kick to the chest, which doubles
                       over the Alien.
    
                       Then Kirk slams the ALIEN on the neck and he goes down.       
                       Kirk starts to walk away.
    
                       But a paw reaches out and grabs him by the ankle. Kirk
                       looks back and the Alien is grinning, drags him in.
                       Stands and grips Kirk's chest to back in a giant bear
                       hug. Surely he will crush the life out of Kirk.
    
                       He lifts Kirk right off the ground. Kirk, almost gone,
                       lifts his legs up high and swings down hard, smashing
                       the Alien in the knee. That does it. The Alien falls
                       to the ground, screaming and holding his knee.

                       Bones tentatively goes forward and examines the knee.
                       He is without any medical tools of any kind.
    
                       The Alien yells but let's him look. He manipulates the
                       leg, then ties a kind of splint with an old rag...
    
                       Kirk looks at Martia. She shakes her head.

                       The hole has led to a new tunnel and the girl
                       rematerializes into THE BRUTE as they crawl. Kirk and
                       Bones, still chained, struggle to keep up.
    
                       They make their way to a large, abandoned opening and
                       come out on

                       a high ice ledge. By scrambling down the ledge and
                       jumping, the BRUTE leads them onto the frigid
                       snowfield. The surface environment is killing.

                       The three slip and slide on the ice across a frozen
                       river. The ICE BEGINS TO CRACK beneath their feet...
    
                       Eventually the three climb the farther bank. They are
                       barely alive. Shaking...

                       going.

                                 I thought I would assume a pleasing
                                 shape.

                       mouth running GREEN blood.

                       Deserted. Scotty, exhausted, is quietly having a cup 
                       of coffee and checking off places searched on a table 
                       map.
    
                       He runs a finger around his collar. It's warm in
                       here...
    
                       Perplexed, he puts his hand over the vent. Nothing
                       coming out. Something blocking it?
    
                       Scotty commences removing the vent cover. Not easy.
    
                       As he continues his efforts, he is unaware of the TWO
                       CREWMEN we met the night of the banquet, watching.
                       They remain concealed, pull knives... one wants to go
                       for Scotty. The other holds him back.
    
                       Scotty removes the vent cover and pulls out what's been
                       blocking the air circulation: two violet-stained
                       Starfleet uniforms, with names on them...
    
                       Excited by his discovery, Scotty looks around, replaces
                       the vent cover and hurries out with the uniforms.

                       to come round.

                       Both Kirks spring apart.
    
                       They are surrounded by a dozen FUR- GARBED KLINGON
                       GUARDS with weapons. SEVERAL have leashed jackal-

                                 Thank you, Captain Sulu.

                                 Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
    
                       He hangs up. Finds himself facing his 1st OFFICER.
    
                                               FIRST OFFICER
                                 You realize you've just committed
                                 treason, Captain.

                                 To be candid, I always hoped that
                                 if the choice ever came down to
                                 betraying my country or betraying
                                 my friend, I'd have the guts to
                                 betray my country. Warp nine,
                                 mister.

                       The lights are dim as Kirk knocks. He has shaved,
                       showered and put on a fresh uniform.
    
                                               KIRK
                                 Spock?
    
                       No answer. Kirk makes to hit the switch.
    
                                               SPOCK
                                 I'd prefer it dark.
    
                       Fair enough. Kirk enters.

                                         (finally)
                                 You were right: it was arrogant
                                 presumption that got us into this
                                 situation. You might have died.

                                 The night is young. Anyway, it was
                                 logical.
                                         (he realizes he must
                                          feel his way)
                                 You know, you're a great one for
                                 logic. I'm a great one for
                                         (shrugs)
                                 rushing in where angels fear to
                                 tread. We're both extremists.
                                 Reality is probably somewhere in
                                 between us.
    
                       Spock says nothing. Kirk runs a finger over dust.

                                 I was blind. I couldn't see past
                                 the death of my son. I couldn't
                                 trust.

                                 I too was blind. I knew about
                                 HER - and I did nothing. I trusted
                                 too much.

                                 You couldn't have known she was
                                 listening the night I dictated that
                                 entry into my log. You were proud
                                 of her achievements as a Vulcan.
    
                                               SPOCK
                                 I was PREJUDUCED by those
                                 achievements.

                                 understood how prejudiced I was...
    
                       Spock looks at him for the first time.

                                 Can we two have grown so old and
                                 inflexible that we have outlived
                                 our usefulness?
                                         (looks at Kirk)
                                 Would that constitute a joke?

                                 Someone said the difference between
                                 comic and cosmic is the letter "S."
                                 You haven't outlived your
                                 usefulness - to me. And you are
                                 not responsible just because she is
                                 also Vulcan -

                                 Not for the actions of another. No

                                 but his own. Human beings -

                       Spock looks at him. Kirk kneels next to him.

                       He holds out his hand; after hesitating, Spock takes
                       it, presses it to his forehead. Hard. HARDER.

                                               UFP PRESIDENT
                                 We are gathered here today in high
                                 hopes, believing that differing
                                 civilizations of good will can work
                                 together to overcome intolerance.
                                 We believe that with understanding
                                 and patience it will be possible to
                                 resolve what separates us. Let us
                                 redefine progress to mean that just
                                 because we CAN do a thing it does
                                 not necessarily follow that we MUST
                                 do that thing.
    
                       APPLAUSE.

                                 We believe that the responsibility
                                 for destiny rests squarely on our
                                 own shoulders...

                                 this the wrong way; our job is to
                                 get to the conference; HER job will
                                 be to stop us.

                                 who said he was an idealist, driven
                                 by visionary notions; others said
                                 he had no choice, that he was a
                                 pragmatic technocrat, making the
                                 best of a devastating situation.
                                 Great men are seldom good men. The
                                 truth is my father was both: a
                                 pragmatist and an idealist. If
                                 Praxis hadn't exploded, then quite
                                 possibly his idealism would not
                                 have found expression. Nor would
                                 mine. We are a proud race. We are
                                 here because we want to go on being
                                 proud...
