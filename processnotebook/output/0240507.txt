    	FADE IN:
    	
    	EXT. 8TH STREET BETWEEN AVENUES C AND D - DAY 
    	
    	A group of dark-skinned girls wearing cheerleading outfits 
    	align themselves in formation on the sidewalk. They begin to 
    	dance. No music can be heard. The sound of the girls' bodies 
    	is our soundtrack. We hear their strained breathing, palms 
    	and sneaker bottoms pounding while they hum and count softly 
    	to themselves in an effort to keep the rhythm.
    	
    	SLO-MO: We explore the bodies of the dancers; their bright 
    	eyes and sweaty brows, their stomping feet and colliding 
    	hands (dark side and light side). The younger girls perform 
    	provocative dance movements, the older girls repeat them.
    	
    	Their bodies silhouette in the bright sunlight.
    	
    	CUT TO: TITLES
    	
    	EXT. AMANDA'S BLOCK - DAY 
    	
    	AMANDA, a tall 14-year-old exits the front door of her 
    	apartment budding with her headphones in one hand and a 
    	magazine in the other. She sits down on her stoop, puts her 
    	headphones on and presses "play". We can hear the sound of 
    	Salsa leaking out of the sides of her headphones. JENETTE, 
    	ten years old with big black hair in rubber-band restraints, sits on 
    	the sidewalk below Amanda drawing with a piece of chalk. Jenette 	
            looks over her shoulder and sees Amanda reading her magazine Jenette 
    	climbs the stairs and sits down beside her.
    	
    	The camera pans to reveal AARON, an 18-year-old boy on the 
    	other side of the street, unloading some fireworks from the 
    	trunk of a car. He's filling a paper bag with them, 
    	carefully making sure not to reveal what he's doing to 
    	onlookers.
    	
    	At the ear end of the block, DONNA, 14, and MICHELLE, 12, 
    	sit and watch Aaron at work.
    	
    				MICHELLE 
    		How does he look up close?
    			
    				DONNA 
    			(Amorously) 
    		Umm, he got dark brownish 
    		eyes, he got a nice nose I 
    		love his nose. I love his 
    		skin. I love his lips, he 
    		got a great smile and he 
    		got-
    	
    				MICHELLE 
    		A bad attitude.
    			
    				DONNA 
    		Yeah, he got a bad 
    		attitude.
    		
    				MICHELLE 
    		You said before, that he 
    		got boxes?
    	
    	SLO-MO: The camera is very close to Aaron. Details of his 
    	body in a shallow depth of field.
    	
    				DONNA 
    		Yeah, he got boxes in his 
    		stomach. He's taller than 
    		me.
    		
    				MICHELLE 
    		How old is he?
    			
    				DONNA 
    		I think he's 18 or 17.
    			
    				MICHELLE 
    		You gonna talk to him?
    			
    				DONNA 
    		Um, yeah I think so.
    			
    	Back on Amanda's stoop.
    	
    				JENETTE 
    		You still like him.
    			
    				AMANDA 
    			(With a sigh of negative attitude) 
    		No.
    			
    	HECTOR, a mature-looking 13-year old is crossing the 
    	street. He enters frame with Amanda and Jenette. 
    	
    				HECTOR 
    		Yo, wuzzup. 
    			
    	Amanda ignores him. 
    	
    				JENETTE 
    		Hi Hector
    			
    				HECTOR 
    			(To Amanda) 
    		Oh, you're not gonna say 
    		hello.
    		
    	AMANDA'S POV: Donna approaches Aaron as he locks up the 
    	trunk of the car. She hesitantly calls over to him. He 
    	acknowledges her with a lift of the chin. Making sure he 
    	keeps his distance from her, he looks around to see if 
    	anyone is watching him. He tosses his head for her to 
    	follow. He begins to walk away down the block. She follows.
    	
    	Hector is looking at Amanda. He appears to have run out of 
    	things to say. Amanda removes her headphones. Her music 
    	becomes clearer, more audible.
    	
    				HECTOR 
    		Yo, you gonna keep me 
    		hangin' like dat?
    	
    				AMANDA 
    	Hector, Yo try to rap to me every day, why don't you 
    	take your three-quarters retarded ass outta here?
    	
    				HECTOR 
    		Yo, you betta give me my 
    		respects or I'll tell your 
    		little girl ova here what 
    		I heard about you and my 
    		boy.
    		
    	Amanda puts her headphones back on.
    	
    	HECTOR looks like he got a new girl anyway.
    	
    	EXT. 8TH STREET BETWEEN AVENUES C AND D - AFTERNOON 
    	
    	VICTOR, a skinny 12-year-old with sloppy hair, is asleep in 
    	the sun on his fire escape. There is sweat beaded up on his 
    	body. His shirt is rolled up behind his head like a pillow. 
    	His breath is heavy, his chest rises and falls. The camera 
    	tilts to reveal CARLOS, ten, rounding the corner on the 
    	street below. The camera tracks backwards as Carlos 
    	approaches. He is talking to himself.
    	
    				CARLOS 
    			(To himself) 
    		Whatcha gonna do when ya 
    		bitch is untrue?
    		
    	Carlos lifts his head up to look at the fire escapes.
    	
    				CARLOS 
    		Yo Victor!
    			
    	The camera pans and tilts up to the fire escapes. The 
    	buildings float by. He arrives in front of Victor's 
    	building and cups his hand around his mouth.
    	
    				CARLOS 
    		Yo Victor!
    			
    	On the fire escape, Victor's eyes pop open and the sun 
    	shines into them.
    	
    				VICTOR 
    			(Dazed) 
    		What, wuzzup?
    			
    	Victor sits up and looks over the side of the fire escape.
    	
    				CARL0S 
    		Come down!
    			
    				VICTOR 
    		I can't!
    			
    				CARLOS 
    		Why?
    			
    				VICTOR 
    		I got punished, man.
    			
    				CARLOS 
    		Fa what?
    			
    				VICTOR 
    		I won't let my motha cut 
    		my hair.
    		
    					CARLOS 
    		Wha'?
    			
    				VICTOR 
    		She fucks it all up!
    		
    				CARLOS 
    		Forget it! C'mon Let's go 
    		to the pool.
    	
    				VICTOR 
    		I can't man, I'm punished!
    			
    				CARL0S 
    		Who gives!
    			
    				VICTOR 
    		I can't, I'm gonna get 
    		punished more!
    	
    				CARLOS 
    		Trust me, I always get 
    		into trouble, c'mon!
    	
    	Victor sits down on the fire escape. Carlos pauses for a 
    	minute and turns his back on Victor.
    	
    				CARL0S 
    		C'mon! The girls are 
    		waiting for you!
    	
    	Victor hops back up.
    	
    				VICTOR 
    			(interested) 
    		They are?
    			
    				CARLOS 
    	Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' 
    	nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of 
    	girls? Be straight up!
    		
    				VICTOR 
    		I'll be right down.
    			
    	Victor climbs down the fire escape and hops down to the 
    	street. he immediately grabs Carlos and starts pushing him 
    	down the block to avoid being seen from above.
    	
    	EXT. THE CORNER OF 8TH STREET AND AVENUE D - CONTINUOUS 
    	
    	The boys safely round the corner onto Avenue D. Victor 
    	perks up and starts nudging Carlos.
    	
    				VICTOR 
    		So what girls are over 
    		there?
    		
    				CARLOS 
    		Natasha, Maria, Tina-
    			
    				VICTOR 
    		These are the pretty girls 
    		you told me to come down 
    		for?
    			
    	Victor sighs and runs his fingers through his hair.
    	
    				CARLOS 
    		What's the difference, you 
    		never do anything anyway
    	
    	Victor makes a disagreeing gesture. Carlos drags Victor 
    		Downtown.
    	
    				VICTOR 
    		What are you going that 
    		way for?
    	
    				CARLOS 
    		I'm not goin' to 10th 
    		Street, people piss and 
    		shit in that pool,
    			
    				VICTOR 
    		Where you goin'?
    			
    				CARLOS 
    		Pitt.
    			
    				VICTOR 
    		Oh man, what we gotta 
    		leave ar' own neighborhood 
    		for?
    			
    				CARLOS 
    		C'mon.

    		Man, if I go down you're 
    		goin' down with me.

    	MONTAGE: Victor and Carlos hang on each other as they walk down 	
            Avenue D towards the Pitt Street Pool. They pass by Victor brother, 	
            giving him an impromptu smack and then bang on a store window to wave 
    	hello to a friend.
    	
    	From Victor's POV we work our way through a crowd of people 
    	an cross 3rd Street. Victor looks back at the crowd with a 
    	watchful eye. The camera tracks along in the street as the 
    	boys walk along the sidewalk. Victor looks up at a street 
    	sign. It reads, "Houston St." As the boys make their way 
    	across the wide intersection, the heat is slightly visible 
    	as car exhaust fills the gridlocked lanes. Victor and 
    	Carlos walk calmly, with space between them, making their 
    	way towards the camera in a shallow depth of field as we 
    	follow focus on them.

    	Victor and Carlos stand on line outside the pool gates. Police 
    	examine the boys as they slowly inch their way into the park.
    	
    	From Victor's POV we see the expanse of the pool as he 
    	enters the park. We watch as he surveys the area.
    	
    	From a high angle we see Carlos nudge Victor to make his 
    	way onto the pool deck. They enter the crowd, proceeding 
    	carefully, making sure not to bump anyone.
    	
    	As they continue to walk, Victor's POV reveals the bodies 
    	of older boys and girls, rough water and mischievous kids.

    	Amanda is sitting poolside with Jenette.
    	
    				AMANDA 
    		And that girl, over there? 
    		Hoochie.
    	
    	Jenette looks out across the pool trying to see who Amanda 
    	is talking about.
    	
    				AMANDA 
    		And him. Stay away from 
    		him, he's only interested 
    		in that.

    	They kiss on the cheek.
    	
    				CARLOS 
    			(To Victor) 
    		Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
    			
    				VICTOR 
    		Eddie from Compost?
    			
    				CARLOS 
    		No, Baruch.
    			
    	A girl swimming in the pool calls over to Carlos.
    	
    				GIRL 1 
    		Carlos! Carlos, get your 
    		skinny ass over here!
    	
    				CARLOS 
    			(To Victor) 
    		Stay right here, I'll be 
    		right back.
    	
    	Carlos walks off leaving Victor standing next to Amanda and 
    	Jenette. Victor looks uncomfortable.
    	
    				AMANDA 
    		Who are you?
    			
    				VICTOR 
    		I'm wit' Carlos.

    		who I'm talkin' about.

    		can't see.

    	Amanda turns to Jenette and continues talking to her.
    	
    				VICTOR 
    		Umm, I'm gonna go find 
    		Carlos.
    		
    	As Victor turns to walk, the camera pans to follow him, 
    	revealing Hector who is approaching Amanda. The camera then 
    	pans back to Amanda. She sighs and turns her ahead away 
    	from him.

    				AARON 
    			(to Boy 1) 
    		You wanna meet my little 
    		friend? 
    	
    	Boy 1 is laughing at Aaron. Donna and Michelle stand nearby 
    	watching.

    		you. I just wanna speak

    		about you.
    		
    				AARON 
    		Hurry up, you're wastin' 
    		my time, what the fuck.
    	
    	Aaron turns back to his friends.
    	
    				DONNA 
    		Please don't scream at me. 
    		I like you, but I don't 
    		like the way your attitude 
    		is.
    		
    				AARON 
    		So get the fuck outta 
    		here.

    		I wanna go out with you, I 
    		want to be part of your

    		I feel and you don't 	
    		understand.
    	
    				AARON 
    		Just get the fuck outta 
    		here.
    		
    	Donna stares at Aaron as he turns back to his friends. 
    	Michelle walks up to Donna and gently leads her away.
    	
    				AARON 
    		That girl be trippin'. 
    			(Back into his Pacino impression)

    				CARLOS 
    		If we were at 10th Street 
    		Pool you woulda done it 
    		right in the water, right?
    			
    	The camera pans as Victor climbs out of the pool and onto a 
    	long line. As he stands and waits, Amanda can be seen in 
    	the background arguing with Hector.
    	
    	In the water, Carlos makes a face at Victor. Victor makes 
    	one back.

    		I'm gonna beat you.

    				AMANDA 
    		I eave me alone!
    			
    				HECTOR

    	Amanda gets on line behind Victor as he continues to antagonize 
    	Carlos in the 
    	distance. Amanda recognizes Victor from behind, peeking 
    	over his shoulder at the side of his face.
    	
    				AMANDA 
    		Shorty!
    			
    	Victor turns around to Amanda.
    	
    				AMANDA

    	In a small corner, out of sight to the rest of the kids at the pool. 
    	Amanda 
    	complains to Victor. Victor looks confused.
    	
    				AMANDA 
    		This fucking guy be 
    		followin' me around, and 
    		touchin' me. Asshole!
    			
    	She sighs and pulls on the bathroom door. It's locked. She 
    	gives it another try. It won't budge.
    	
    				AMANDA 
    		Look, just do me a favor. 
    		Stand right here, okay?
    	
    	Amanda takes Victor's hand for balance and squats down, 
    	pulling her bathing suit bottoms to the side. She urinates. 
    	Victor watches her, trying to play it cool. The camera 
    	tilts up from Amanda's face peeking up at Victor, to their 
    	hands straining for balance, to Victor's wandering eyes.

    	Amanda's block is quiet and empty.
    	
    	Chris strolls by Amanda's stoop.
    	
    	He notices Jenette's drawing, bends down on his knees and 
    	reads her sloppy writing.
    	
    	"For entrance to secret passage press here."
    	
    	Chris presses his finger into the circle she's drawn. A 
    	moment passes. Nothing happens.
    	
    	A sound is heard atop Amanda's stoop. Chris quickly walks 
    	away. Amanda appears through her front door.
    	
    	She sits down on her stoop.
    	
    	Victor is sitting on the curb across the street tapping an 
    	empty bottle against the pavement. He sees Amanda.
    	
    	Victor approaches Amanda's stoop.
    	
    				VICTOR 
    		Yo.
    			
    				AMANDA 
    		Hi.
    			
    				VICTOR 
    		Remember me, from the 
    		pool?
    		
    				AMANDA
    		Um. Yeah! Shorty!
    		
    	A pause.
    	
    				AMANDA 
    		So watcha doin'?
    			
    				VICTOR 
    		Nothin'.
    			
    				AMANDA 
    		What are you doin' here?
    			
    					VICTOR 
    		I, umm, came to see you.
    			
    				AMANDA 
    		You know somebody around 
    		here?
    		
    				VICTOR 
    		No. 
    			(He sighs) 
    		What you do today?
    			
    					AMANDA 
    		Oh you know, cleaned the 
    		house, cooked. Took care 
    		of my little sisters. Sit 
    		down. So where's Carlos?
    	
    				VICTOR 
    		I guess he's outside 
    		someplace I don't like 
    		takin' him down to certain 
    		places.
    		
    	Victor sits down.
    	
    				AMANDA 
    		Whadja wanna see me about?
    			
    				VICTOR 
    		I just wanted to see you.
    			
    	A pause.
    	
    				AMANDA 
    		So you got a girl?
    			
    				VICTOR 
    		Of course.
    			
    				AMANDA 
    		So what's her name?
    			
    				VICTOR 
    		You know. I got a lot, 
    		more than one.
    	
    				AMANDA 
    		A play-ya.
    			
    				VICTOR 
    		You got a boyfriend?
    			
    				AMANDA 
    		Me? No. Don't want none 
    		either. Such bastards, man.
    		
    	A pause.
    	
    				AMANDA 
    			(Quickly) 
    		They play a girl, then you 
    		complain, then they play 
    		dumb, blah, blah, blah. 
    		All that bullshit, 
    		whatever I don't want 
    		none. I'm gonna stay 
    		single awhile, you know?
    			
    	A pause.
    	
    				AMANDA 
    		So wadda you do with your 
    		girls?
    	
    				VICTOR
    		Just chill.
    			
    				AMANDA 
    		That's it?
    			
    				VICTOR 
    		Nah, we make out and 
    		stuff.
    		
    	Amanda doesn't believe him.
    	
    				AMANDA 
    		So what you think of me?
    			
    				VICTOR 
    		You look good.
    			
    				AMANDA 
    		I look good, that's it. So 
    		what else do you do for 
    		these girls?
    			
    				VICTOR 
    		I buy them flowers.
    			
    				AMANDA 
    		How you treat them?
    			
    				VICTOR 
    		Good. I'm faithful to 
    		them.
    		
    	Amanda gets up and walks away. Victor quickly follows.
    		
    	EXT. ALLEYWAY - MOMENTS LATER
    	
    	Amanda walks through the half-open fence and leans flat 
    	against the wall. Victor stands close by, nervously.
    	
    	He keeps his distance from her.
    	
    				AMANDA
    		See, I got you, you are so 
    		scared. I don't believe 
    		that you kissed no girls. 
    		That you got three girls 
    		and that you faithful and 
    		this and that.
    	
    				VICTOR
    		I did.
    			
    				AMANDA 
    		Well, you know I'm 
    		standin' here and you say 
    		I look good?
    			
    				VICTOR 
    		I kissed those girls.
    			
    				AMANDA 
    		No you didn't, you ain't 
    		provin'it.
    	
    				VICTOR 
    		I aint gotta prove nothin' 
    		to no girl, 'cause I got 
    		it like dat.
    			
    				AMANDA 
    		Oh, 'cause you got it like 
    		dat?
    		
    	Victor approaches Amanda. He touches her arm. Amanda 
    	smiles.
    	
    	She takes Victor's hand and places it on her breast. Victor 
    	moves forward. Amanda moves his hand over her breasts. She 
    	wraps her arms around his waist. Victor bends his arms 
    	around her back.
    	
    	Amanda hisses him on the lips, slowly. A long, deep kiss. 
    	As she kisses him she runs her hand through his hair. She 
    	pulls back. Victor looks around. Chris is at the entrance 
    	of the alleyway, watching them. He is holding his deflated football.
    	
    	Chris looks at him for a second and walks away.
    	
    	Chris walks down the block, his bat against the pavement.
