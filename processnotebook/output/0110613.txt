           CLOSE-UP OF VADA SULTENFUSS' FACE
    
                                       VADA
                  I remember before I was born, wounded up like 
                  a fur ball in the highly overrated fetal 
                  position, luckily I'm not claustrophobic, but 
                  on rainy days I still feel a tightness in my 
                  left shoulder. So now that my stepmother's 
                  pregnant, I understand what the baby's going 
                  through, and I'm not jealous at all, really, 
                  not at all.
    
           VIEW OF THE SULTENFUSS' DINING ROOM TABLE. VADA, HARRY AND 
           SHELLY ARE SEATED. SHELLY IS VERY PREGNANT
    
                                       HARRY
                  Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
    
                                       SHELLY
                  If I eat it I'll throw up.
    
                                       HARRY
                  Well you should at least try a little bit.
    
                                       SHELLY
                  Then I'll throw up a little bit.
    
                                       VADA
                         (to Shelly's stomach)
                  Are you sure you wanna get involved in this?
    
           OUTSIDE SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, MUSIC IS PLAYING OUR HOUSE, 
           INSIDE HARRY IS SINGING
    
                                       HARRY
                  ...windows are illuminated by the evening 
                  sunshine through them firey gems for you, only 
                  for you, our house, is a very, very, very fine 
                  house, with two cats in the yard, life used to 
                  be so hard, now everything is easy 'cause of 
                  you...
    
           Harry walks to Vada who is placing chairs in rows in the 
           funeral room
    
                                       HARRY
                  Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a 
                  little more.
    
                                       VADA
                  Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't 
                  scrunch.
    
           Doorbell rings
    
                                       ARTHUR
                  I'll get it.
    
                                       HARRY
                  Well I guess we'll just set up more chairs in 
                  the library and pipe the sermon in like we did 
                  with Old Man Hasselmeyer.
    
                                       VADA
                  Better fix that speaker, it makes the 
                  minister sound like an astronaut.
    
           Arthur opens the front door to reveal Judy
    
                                       ARTHUR
                  Oh, hello Judy.
    
                                       JUDY
                  Hi Arthur.
    
           Harry walks past
    
                                       HARRY
                  Hi Judy, come on in.
    
                                       JUDY
                  Hi Mr. Sultenfuss.
    
                                       ARTHUR
                         (to Vada)
                  Look who I found.
    
                                       VADA
                  Hi Judy!
    
           Judy doesn't enter the funeral room. She doesn't like the 
           idea of being anywhere near a corpse
    
                                       JUDY
                         (nervous)
                  Hi.
    
                                       VADA
                  Come on in!
    
                                       JUDY
                  That's okay.
    
                                       VADA
                  It's just a corpse.
    
                                       JUDY
                  I know that.
    
                                       VADA
                  You should be here when they bring in a body 
                  that's been dead for a couple of days, and 
                  they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an 
                  apartment, and no-one came to visit, or 
                  floating in a river, and then the body starts 
                  turning this weird shade of green, you know, 
                  like watery pea soup? The arms and legs 
                  deteriorate first, the body looks like a 
                  raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why 
                  I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??
    
           front door closes
    
                  Judy???
    
                                       ARTHUR
                  I think you lost on the raisin with the four 
                  fat legs honey.
    
           LIVING ROOM, HARRY AND SHELLY ARE SITTING WATCHING TV, VADA 
           GETS A DRINK AND JOINS THEM
    
           Harry and Shelly are laughing
    
                                       HARRY
                  I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los 
                  Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
    
                                       VADA
                  I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body 
                  surfing.
    
                                       SHELLY
                  I don't know if I want to.
    
                                       HARRY
                  Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you 
                  can absolutely say no if you want to.
    
           Shelly gives Harry a look
    
                  I'm just bringing it up for discussion.
    
                                       SHELLY
                  But Harry, I thought we decided we weren't 
                  gonna do this.
    
           Vada looks confused
    
                                       VADA
                  Do what?
    
                                       HARRY
                  Well the thing is your room is right next 
                  door to ours, and so we thought, well, I 
                  thought, if you were willing we might move you 
                  to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for 
                  the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the 
                  night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of 
                  noise....
    
                                       VADA
                  You want me to move?
    
                                       HARRY
                  Well not far, just down the hall. Plus 
                  Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a 
                  view of the whole neighborhood.
    
           Vada looks a little put out
    
                                       VADA
                  Okay, no problem.
    
                                       HARRY
                  Okay thanks, atta girl.
    
           OUTSIDE, ON THE DECK, HARRY IS PLAYING HIS TUBA, SHELLY 
           COMES OUT
    
                                       SHELLY
                         (at the door)
                  Harry? 
                         (closer, a little louder)
                  HARRY?? 
                         (in Harry's ear)
    
                  *HARRY*!!!!
    
           Harry gets a fright and blows a foul note
    
                  I'm sorry to interrupt honey but Vada's 
                  upset.
    
                                       HARRY
                  Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.
    
                                       SHELLY
                  Look we react to every kick this baby gives, 
                  maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.
    
           BOWLING ALLEY, VADA AND HARRY ARE BOWLING, CLOSE UP OF 
           HARRY HOLDING UP HIS BALL
    
                                       HARRY
                  The thing to remember is you must visualize a 
                  spare. The parabola of the arcing ball must 
                  intersect with the pyramid of the pins at 
                  precisely this angle of attack.
    
           Harry bowls his ball, which goes straight into the side 
           ditch
    
                  Shit.
    
           Harry walks back to Vada
    
                                       VADA
                  Visualize a spare?
    
                                       HARRY
                  Well you know what I mean.
    
                                       VADA
                  So, what's on your mind?
    
                                       HARRY
                  Me? What makes you think there's something on 
                  my mind?
    
                                       VADA
                  You're passing up Archie Bunker to go 
                  bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
    
                                       HARRY
                  No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of 
                  us had an evening out so we could... talk.
    
           Vada stands up and picks up a ball
    
                                       VADA
                  Shelly's already told me all about sex.
    
                                       HARRY
                  She told me too, I mean, she told me she told 
                  you about sex, I personally new about sex long 
                  before I met Shelly.
    
                                       VADA
                  I figured you did.
    
           Vada bowls her ball and gets a perfect strike
    
                                       VADA
                  Yes!
    
           Vada returns and sits down
    
                                       HARRY
                  Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this 
                  talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been 
                  a lot of changes, and I know you're upset 
                  about losing your room, but the baby's gotta 
                  go somewhere.
    
                                       VADA
                  No it's okay, I understand, really.
    
                                       HARRY
                  Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you 
                  Vada.
    
           Harry then gets up to bowl again
    
                                       VADA
                  Maybe I should just move to China. One kid 
                  per family, that way you don't lose your room.
    
                                       HARRY
                  Hey, why don't you just keep your room and 
                  we'll put the baby in the back yard.
    
                                       VADA
                  Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
    
                                       HARRY
                  Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and 
                  the weed killer.
    
                                       VADA
                  Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
    
                                       HARRY
                  Seriously?
    
                                       VADA
                  Seriously.
    
                                       HARRY
                  Great.
    
           Harry stands poised to bowl...
    
                                       VADA
                  I'm thirteen, maybe it's about time I got my 
                  own apartment.  
    
           THUD, Harry drops his ball and turns around looking 
           staggered, then sees that Vada is definitely kidding
    
           VADA AND JUDY ARE IN A SHOP SMELLING PERFUMES
    
                                       JUDY
                  My mother can't have any more kids.
    
                                       VADA
                  Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly 
                  who's pregnant.
    
                                       JUDY
    
                         (raising wrist to Vada's nose)
                  What do you think?
    
           Vada smells Judy's wrist
    
                                       VADA
                  I think I'm leaning towards passionflower, it 
                  combines the traditional floral scent with the 
                  musty aroma of samba wood.
    
           a group of teenage guys enter the shop
    
                                       VADA
                  What are you staring at?
    
                                       JUDY
                  It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
    
                                       VADA
                  See you? He can smell you from there.
    
                                       JUDY
                  Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, 
                  totally natural.
    
           Vada and Judy stand close to a rack of sunglasses, Kevin 
           and his two friends approach
    
                                       JUDY
                         (looks at Kevin with a large smile, 
                         and slowly takes her sunglasses off)
    
                  Hi Kevin.
    
                                       KEVIN
                  Hi.
    
           Vada turns around wearing sunglasses with ENORMOUS lenses
    
                                       KEVIN
                         (to Vada)
                  Real cool Sultenfuss, you look like a 
                  grasshopper.
    
           His group of friends laugh and move off
    
                                       VADA
                  What's the matter?
    
                                       JUDY
                  He likes you.
    
                                       VADA
                  Likes me? He said I looked like a 
                  grasshopper.
    
                                       JUDY
                  Boys always pretend they hate you when they 
                  really like you.
    
                                       VADA
                  That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't 
                  stand someone, then you pretend that you're 
                  really crazy about them?
    
                                       JUDY
                  I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a 
                  jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all 
                  yours!
    
                                       VADA'S THOUGHTS
                  If grasshopper is a term of endearment, I've 
                  got a lot to learn.
    
           BEDROOM IN SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, ARTHUR, SHELLY, HARRY AND 
           VADA ARE MOVING AROUND DOING VARIOUS THINGS
    
                                       ARTHUR
                  So have you guys thought of any new names for 
                  the baby?
    
           Vada looks annoyed and drops with a thud the load of books 
           she is carrying
    
                                       SHELLY
                  Umm, yeah, if it's a girl I'm kinda leaning 
                  toward Esme.
    
                                       ARTHUR
                  Esme?
    
                                       HARRY
                  Yeah, you know that kinda sounds like a noise 
                  your nose makes, 
                         (nasalised)
                  es-MEH. I mean it's...
    
                                       ARTHUR
                  And what if it's a boy?
    
                                       HARRY
                  Oh Harry Junior of course.
    
                                       VADA
                  Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend 
                  that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends 
                  that he doesn't like you how can you tell that 
                  he likes you?
    
                                       HARRY
                  What boy likes you?
    
                                       VADA
                  It's just a question, it's not about anybody.
    
                                       ARTHUR
                  Uh oh, here comes puberty.
    
                                       SHELLY
                  Vada, I think what you're talking about is 
                  the fear of rejection. You see men will do 
                  anything to avoid looking foolish.
    
                                       HARRY
                  Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my 
                  needle nosed pliers?
    
                                       SHELLY
                  Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with 
                  you, it really means he didn't have nerve to 
                  ask you out on a date, so you'll get your 
                  homework together and pretend to be studying, 
                  and the next thing you know you're ordering 
                  pizza and talking about your favorite movie 
                  stars.
    
                                       VADA
                  So you're saying...What are you saying??
    
                                       HARRY
                  Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over 
                  anxious, so if you think there's a boy that 
                  might like you, let him know that you like 
                  him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk 
                  when he's thinking of asking you out.
    
                  Okay?
    
           OUTSIDE, VADA IS RIDING HER BIKE DOWN THE PAVEMENT AND 
           ARRIVES AT JUDY'S HOUSE
    
           Vada presses the doorbell, Judy opens the door
    
                                       JUDY
                  Hi.
    
                                       VADA
                  Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my 
                  new room tomorrow?
    
                                       JUDY
                  ehh...I don't know I mean....
    
           Kevin appears from inside the house holding a carton of 
           juice
    
                                       KEVIN
                  Is it okay if I drink this?
    
                                       VADA
                  It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
    
                                       KEVIN
                  Well if it isn't Vada, the grasshopper girl.
    
                                       JUDY
                  Stop it Kevin.
    
                                       KEVIN
                  I was kidding, it's a joke okay.
    
                                       JUDY
                  We were just doing our homework and studying 
                  for the test.
    
                                       VADA
                  And the next thing you know you're gonna be 
                  ordering pizza and talking about your favorite 
                  movie stars. See ya.
    
           Vada gets on her bike and rides off
    
                                       VADA'S THOUGHTS
                  In the future I think I'll stick to asking 
                  Dad for advice on embalming.
    
           VADA IS CLIMBING THE STAIRS COMING TOWARD THE CAMERA, SHE 
           HEARS SHELLY SINGING "BABY LOVE" AND HARRY PLAYING THE TUBA 
           IN A BEDROOM AND ENTERS
    
                                       SHELLY
                  Baby, Baby, Baby love, my baby love, I need 
                  you oh how I need you, why do you do me like 
                  you do, haven't I been good to you, so deep in 
                  love with you, Baby, Baby.
    
                  I read an article that says if you sing to 
                  the baby it's a calming influence.
    
                                       VADA
                  Assuming the baby's a "Supremes" fan.
    
                                       SHELLY
                  I bet your mom sang to you.
    
                                       HARRY
                  Well if there was an article about it I'm 
                  sure she did. She was always reading.
    
                                       SHELLY
                  Yes I know, it runs in the family. 
                         (to Vada)
                  New book?
    
                                       VADA
                  The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer
    
                                       HARRY
                  Her favorite poet.
    
                                       SHELLY
                         (shaking head)
                  Never heard of him.
                         (burp} 
                  Excuse me.
    
                                       HARRY
                  How about a nice glass of milk?
    
                                       SHELLY
                  And some taco chips so I can dunk.
    
           Harry leaves, and Shelly leans forward to talk to Vada
    
                                       SHELLY
                  You know Vada, being an older sister, you're 
                  gonna be very important in this baby's life.
    
           Vada's glance shifts onto Shelly's enlarged breasts, she 
           smiles, a little embarrassed, Shelly looks down at them and 
           laughs
    
                                       SHELLY
                  They're enormous, I know.
    
                                       VADA
                  Is there milk in them already?
    
                                       SHELLY
                  No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
    
                                       VADA
                  When did you umm, I mean umm...
    
                                       SHELLY
                  Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to 
                  call me "Shelly Two Backs". All my friends had 
                  real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
    
                                       VADA
                  Why do they call them training bra's? It's 
                  not like learning to ride a bike.
    
                                       SHELLY
                  I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing 
                  you for the rest of your life. It's not easy 
                  being a woman.
    
                                       VADA
                  You're telling me.
    
           VADA'S ROOM, BOXES EVERYWHERE, VADA IS LYING ON HER BED 
           THINKING TO HERSELF
    
                                       VADA'S THOUGHTS
                  All the great writers pondered the meaning of 
                  life and death. I've been thinking a lot about 
                  my mother recently, even though I don't have 
                  any memories of her. I wish I could see her 
                  just once, even if it were only in a dream. I 
                  know she'd help me figure things out.
    
           VADA'S ENGLISH CLASS AT SCHOOL
    
                                       MR. OWETT
                  Bless me now with your fierce tears I pray, 
                  do not go gentle into that good night, rage, 
                  rage against the dying of the light.
    
                  What do you think Dylan Thomas is saying 
                  here? "Rage against the dying of the light."
    
                                       KEVIN
                  He's mad 'cause they shut-off his 
                  electricity.
    
           class laughs
    
                                       MR. OWETT
                  I think he was referring to life energy Mr. 
                  Phillips, which in your case wouldn't cause 
                  much of a power shortage, now would it?
    
           class goes "oooohh", Vada then raises her hand
    
                                       MR. OWETT
                  Vada?
    
                                       VADA
                  The poem is really about attitude. It's about 
                  not giving up and...it's easy to be 
                  overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we 
                  should...force ourselves to push on.
    
                  Alfred Biedermeyer said, "To heed the urgent 
                  inner voice, embracing destiny, not choice".
    
                                       MR. OWETT
                  That's very good Vada. All right, moving on, 
                  I want to give you guys a chance to write.
    
           class does an "awe man"
    
                  Hey, hey, hey, listen up, I want you to write 
                  about someone very special, someone 
                  interesting, someone you admire, someone who 
                  has achieved something worth writing about, 
                  but it's gotta be a stranger, someone you've 
                  never met, I want you to investigate the 
                  personal side, play Perry Mason, see what you 
                  can come up with. All right? Any ideas?

                  Vada what about you, who have you come up 
                  with?
    
                                       VADA
                  My mother.

                  Your mother?
    
                                       VADA
                  I never met my mother.
    
           VADA, HARRY AND SHELLY ARE WALKING DOWN TOWN TALKING
    
                                       VADA
                  I know my mom's favorite color was pink, and 
                  she ate peanut butter and banana sandwiches 
                  for breakfast, but that's not what I would 
                  call hard hammered facts.
    
                                       HARRY
                  I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?
    
                                       SHELLY
                  No.
    
                                       HARRY
                  Ah, well, I bought her this huge pumpkin for 
                  Halloween, but she couldn't bear to carve it 
                  so she saved it for weeks, and it ended up 
                  under the Christmas tree.
    
                                       VADA
                  Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was 
                  this sickening smell permeating the entire 
                  house.
    
                                       SHELLY
                  Oh no.
    
                                       HARRY
                  Yeah when I picked it up it sort of exploded 
                  and liquefied at the same time.
    
           Shelly laughs
    
                  It wasn't funny, it soaked clear through 
                  Grammoo's oriental.
    
                                       VADA
                  There's still a big spot on the floor.
    
           INSIDE A GENERAL STORE, VADA, SHELLY AND HARRY ENTER
    
                                       HARRY
                  Okay, we need wallpaper paste. 
                         (to shop owner)
                  Hey Cece!
    
                                       VADA
                  Oh, is there anything else you remember, how 
                  did you propose? Was it romantic?
    
                                       HARRY
                  Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root 
                  beer float.
    
                                       SHELLY
                  Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
    
                                       VADA
                  Did she mention any contests that she won? I 
                  mean she must have had some awards, she was so 
                  talented and all.
    
                                       HARRY
                  She was talented, but honey I wish I could 
                  help you a little more, it's just that your 
                  mother and I had kind of a whirlwind 
                  courtship, she came to town with this 
                  traveling theater group, I proposed on our 
                  second date, two weeks later we were married 
                  and almost nine months later you were here and 
                  she was gone.
    
                                       VADA
                  Was it a nice funeral?
    
                                       HARRY
                  Oh yes, lovely funeral, Gernaldi brothers did 
                  a beautiful job, lots of pink roses...I used 
                  the white hearse. Hey, how about this flowered 
                  wallpaper for your room?
    
           Vada pulls out a roll of pitch black wallpaper and shows it

                  Hi Mr. Owett.
    
                                       MR. OWETT
                  Hey Vada. How's your report coming?
    
                                       VADA
                  Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know 
                  where to start.
    
                                       MR. OWETT
                  You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, 
                  I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a 
                  fascinating life.
    
                                       VADA
                  Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my 
                  mom, she led a fascinating life too.
    
                                       MR. OWETT
                  I'm sure she did. 
                         (to Judy and Kevin, who are standing 
                         near Vada)
    
                  Hey guys.
    
                                       KEVIN
                  Vada, he was giving you an easy out so you 
                  wouldn't have to write about your mother.
    
                                       VADA
                  But I wanna write about her.
    
                                       KEVIN
                  You're crazy, what was her big achievement? 
                  Did she invent gravity?
    
                                       VADA
                  No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
    
                                       JUDY
                  Then what did she do?
    
                                       VADA
                  Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but 
                  since I'm gonna write about it I might as well 
                  tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.
    
                                       KEVIN
                  Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? 
                  And where did she spy on the Russians from, 
                  here in Pennsylvania??
    
                                       VADA
                  No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to 
                  Russia undercover with her acting troupe and 
                  got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans 
                  sent back. Just when she was about to go home, 
                  she got caught, and they killed her.
    
                                       KEVIN
                  All right, so when did she have you between 
                  all her acting and spying and getting caught?
    
                                       VADA
                  That's simple. She was pregnant with 
                  me...when she went to Russia and she didn't 
                  know...and then when the Russians found out, 
                  they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not 
                  allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the 
                  world.
    
                                       JUDY
                  So she had you in jail, in Russia?
    
                                       VADA
                  Well actually I was born in Siberia and then 
                  they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
    
                                       KEVIN
                  Vada, if bullshit wore a bra, you'd be topic. 
                  Come on Judy.
    
           Kevin and Judy walk off
    
                                       VADA
                  Ohh...ask anyone, ask my Dad!
                         (pause)
                  Could be true.
    
           Vada goes to her locker and opens it, exchanging books
    
                                       VADA'S THOUGHTS
                  How come guys talk so much when they have 
                  nothing to say, and girls have plenty to say, 
                  but no-one will listen.

                                       VADA
                  I used to come down here and sleep on this 
                  spot when I was little.
    
                  My report is gonna be a disaster, everything 
                  I know about her fits into one little box.
    
                                       SHELLY
                  A box?
    
           TOP VIEW OF BOX, VADA AND SHELLY ARE SITTING ON A BED 
           LOOKING THROUGH IT
    
                                       SHELLY
                  Oh Vada, what a sweet baby book!
    
                                       VADA
                  It's only filled out to page two. I was eight 
                  pounds, four ounces.
                         (looking further in box)
                  There's so many programs, she was in a lot of 
                  plays.
    
                  Dad said that when she was on stage, she held 
                  the audience in the palm of her hand.

                  What's this? December 8th, 1958?
    
                                       VADA
                  I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
    
                                       SHELLY
                  Well, it must mean something. She was 
                  obviously very sentimental.

                  passport.

                  Margaret Ann Muldovan, Born in Los Angeles, 
                  California, February 7th 1936. Aquarius.
    
                                       VADA
                  Margaret's my middle name, but everybody 
                  called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever 
                  been there?
    
                                       SHELLY
                  No. You know they say, that it never rains, 
                  that you can barbecue on Christmas 
                  day...instead of riding your bike, you just 
                  surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the 
                  place is just crawling with celebrities. I 
                  know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up 
                  his dry-cleaning.
    
                                       VADA
                  Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
    
                                       SHELLY
                  Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little 
                  adventure.
    
                                       VADA
                  I wonder why she got a passport if she never 
                  went anywhere.
    
                                       SHELLY
                  Well you've gotta be prepared.
    
                                       VADA
                  I'm definitely traveling some day.
    
           Shelly gets an idea
    
                                       SHELLY
                  Why not now?
    
                                       VADA
                  What do you mean?
    
                                       SHELLY
                  How would you like to go visit your Uncle 
                  Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your 
                  spring vacation, you could do research on your 
                  mom.
    
                                       VADA
                  But what about you and the baby? You need me.
    
                                       SHELLY
                  Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for 
                  another six weeks or so.
    
                                       VADA
                  Yeah, it would be kinda great.
    
                                       SHELLY
                  It would be fantastic.
    
                                       VADA
                  But Dad'll never go for it.
    
                                       SHELLY
                  You leave your father to me.
    
           FOYER OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, HARRY AND SHELLY ENTER THROUGH 
           A DOOR ARGUING
    
                                       SHELLY
                  We should encourage her to spread her wings.
    
                                       HARRY
                  She can spread her wings, right here in 
                  Pennsylvania. You don't send a child alone to 
                  Los Angeles, she could come back with her ears 
                  pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what 
                  else.
    
                                       SHELLY
                  She is not a child Harry, she is a young 
                  woman, she's on the brink of...
    
                                       HARRY
                  Disaster, disaster lurks behind every
                         (hesitates)
                  palm tree.
    
                                       SHELLY
                  You're being narrow-minded.
    
           Harry begins to move up the stairs
    
                                       HARRY
                  Look, maybe when she's a little older, I'd be 
                  more then happy to bring up...
    
           Vada approaches from upstairs
    
                         (to Vada)
                  Ohh...Hi Vada, we were just having a 
                  little....
    
                                       VADA
                  You were just having a fight about me. 
                  Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
    
                                       HARRY
                  Of course.
    
                                       VADA
                  I think that if I'm old enough to accept a 
                  new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a 
                  new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
    
                                       HARRY
                  Honey I know it's fun to think about these 
                  things but....
    
                                       VADA
                  I already bought a ticket.
    
                                       HARRY
                  What??
    
                                       VADA
                  I used my own money and got a great deal, 
                  it's a Q47NR five day fare, which means that I 
                  have to change planes in Dallas and stay over 
                  a Saturday.
    
                  There's no exchanges or refunds, so...if you 
                  don't let me go then I will have wasted my 
                  entire life savings.
    
                                       HARRY
                  Ah, uh, uh, bu...but...but I... I... Isn't it 
                  against the law to sell airline tickets to 
                  minors?
    
           Harry looks at Shelly, who looks guilty
    
                  Don't tell me you aided and abetted this 
                  little scheme?
    
                                       SHELLY
                  Well, Vada needed me.
    
           Vada leaves the room
    
                  Besides the airline requires the signature of 
                  an adult.
    
                                       HARRY
                  Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who 
                  wasn't having hormone surges.
    
                                       SHELLY
                  Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five 
                  days here.
    
                                       HARRY
                  I really think we're going overboard for just 
                  a simple school assignment.
    
           VADA IS BACK IN LIVING ROOM, RUBBING HER HAND ON THE 
           PUMPKIN STAIN SPOT, WE CAN HEAR HARRY AND SHELLY IN THE 
           BACKGROUND
    
                                       SHELLY
                  But it's not a little school assignment. I 
                  think maybe all of this is happening for a 
                  reason.
    
                                       HARRY
                  Reason? What reason?
    
           VADA LIES DOWN AND PUTS HER HEAD ON THE SPOT
    
                                       SHELLY
                  Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the 
                  baby being born, Vada's report, I think...
    
           CAMERA IS BACK ON SHELLY AND HARRY
    
                  ...maybe all of these are signs, signs that 
                  it's time for Vada to take this trip.
    
                                       HARRY
                  Signs. OOOOOOOOOOOH, let me get the loch ness 
                  monster on the phone, you two have a lot to 
                  talk about. No, I'm sorry, Vada is NOT going 
                  to Los Angeles, now I have made my decision 
                  and that is final.
    
           AT THE AIRPORT, VADA AND HARRY ARE WALKING OUT TOWARDS THE 
           CHECK IN DESK
    
                                       HARRY
                  And remember don't talk to anyone, even if a 
                  nun sits next to you, don't talk to her.
    
                                       VADA
                  No nuns, got it.
    
                                       HARRY
                  And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people 
                  are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and 
                  on drugs...and don't come running to me when 
                  you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on 
                  your toe having been beaten up into an 
                  unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T 
                  make eye contact, it communicates an implied 
                  vulnerability.
    
           Vada hands her ticket to the attendant
    
                                       VADA
                  What does that mean?
    
                                       HARRY
                  It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never 
                  let his baby girl out of his sight for the 
                  simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why 
                  don't you just say "Oh Dad" and get on the 
                  damn plane already?
    
           Vada gives Harry a hug
    
                                       VADA
                  Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
    
                                       HARRY
                  Thanks, I needed that.
    
                                       VADA
                  I'll be back in 137 hours.
    
                                       HARRY
                  Have fun.
    
           Vada waves as she boards the plane
    
                  Not too much.
    
           OUTSIDE VIEW OF AIRBORNE PLANE, SWITCHES TO INSIDE VIEW OF 
           VADA AT HER WINDOW SEAT, SHE GETS OUT HER BOX AND LOOKS 
           THROUGH IT AGAIN
    
                                       VADA'S THOUGHTS
                  It's hard to believe that my mother's whole 
                  life fits into this box. I've just gotta think 
                  of this stuff as clues...or good luck charms.
    
                  But I need more than luck to solve this 
                  puzzle, I need a miracle.
    
           CONVEYOR BELT AT AIRPORT IN LA VADA'S BAG DROPS ONTO BELT 
           AND BEGINS TO MOVE ALONG, AT FIRST ATTEMPT VADA MISSES HER 
           BAG, THEN SHE GETS IT
    
           Vada has her bag and stands in the middle of the terminal 
           waiting, a boy is seen running into the building, he stops 
           and looks around, passing straight by Vada, then turning and 
           trying to get a look at her, Vada will not allow this as she 
           keeps turning away from him
    
                                       BOY
                  Are you waiting for someone?
    
           Vada stays turned away and does not reply
    
                                       BOY
                  Excuse me I asked you a question.
    
                                       VADA
                  I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not 
                  even nuns.
    
                                       BOY
                  You're Vada right?
    
           Vada turns nervously and looks at him
    
                                       VADA
                  How did you know my name?
    
                                       BOY
                  Your Uncle Phil told me.
    
                                       VADA
                  Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
    
                                       BOY
                  Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or 
                  something?
    
                                       VADA
                  This is California, anything is possible.  
    
                                       BOY
                  Well if I was looking for a victim, I 
                  definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who 
                  outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who 
                  would I ask for ransom? You??
    
                                       VADA
                  Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance 
                  or is it just an attitude problem.
    
                                       BOY
                  My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is 
                  giving me five bucks to pick you up but I 
                  don't get paid 'till delivery.
    
                                       VADA
                  Gee, that is a problem.
    
           the boy picks up Vada's suitcase and begins to walk off 
           with it
    
                                       VADA
                  Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
    
                                       BOY
                  What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a 
                  polite person helped carry your bag?
    
                                       VADA
                  I don't think you're very polite.
    
                                       BOY
                  Yeah, well I don't think you're very 
                  grateful. A lot of people in your position 
                  would say "thank you".
    
           he begins to move off, Vada follows
    
                                       VADA
                  THANK YOU.
    
                                       BOY
                  Don't mention it.
    
                                       VADA

           CAMERA IS FOLLOWING TAXI FROM SKY, SONG IS PLAYING 
           SWINGTOWN VADA IS WATCHING OUT WINDOW ALL THE SIGHTS, THEY 
           PASS AN OIL PUMP, A HUGE DONUT STORE, CAPITOL RECORDS 
           BUILDING ETC.
    
           Vada waves out the window to a surfer in a red convertible, 
           then they turn off, and pull up to a building with "BUDAPEST 
           auto repair" written on it

                  There you go.
                         (to Vada)
                  See that building, my grandfather built it. 
                  Budapest auto repair.
                         (points)
                  That's my room right up there. One of these 
                  days this is all gonna be mine.
    
           Vada enters the large garage and sees Phil walking inwards
    
                                       VADA
                  Uncle Phil!!
    
           Phil turns around
    
                                       PHIL
                  Vada!! 
           Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms 
                  Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You 
                  look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?
    
                                       VADA
                  They're great.
    
                                       PHIL
                  How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
    
                                       VADA
                  He was very polite, worth the entire five 
                  dollars.
    
                                       PHIL
                  Uh huh, well...good to know.
           Phil hands Nick a               5 note
    
                                       NICK
                  Thanks

                         phone under her ear)
                  Give it back Nicholas!
    
                                       NICK
                  But we made a business deal.
    
                                       ROSE
                  What ever happened to a good old-fashioned 
                  favor huh?
    
           Nick returns the               5

                         (into phone)
                  Now Irving our family's been dealing with 
                  your company for over forty years now, now 
                  either the timing chain is here or isn't here 
                  and from what I can see it isn't here, now you 
                  wanna come down and explain to the customers 
                  why we can't re-assemble the cars because not 
                  all the parts are here.
    
                  Now come on, I have enough trouble keeping my 
                  weight down, I don't need this blubber from 
                  you, are we quite clear on this Irving or do I 
                  have to speak with your father?
                         (pause)
                  Thank you. Yes, yes I love you too Irving. 
           she then hangs up, and notices Vada
    
                  You must be Vada! Oh what a face! 
           she leans over and hugs Vada 
                  Oh if I had a face like that I wouldn't have 
                  to yell so much. I'm Rose, Rose Zsigmond, 
                  Nick's mother among other things.
    
                                       VADA
                  You're Nick's mother?
    
                                       ROSE
                  What, did you think he was raised by a pack 
                  of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.
    
                                       NICK
                  Mom!
    
           Phil moves over to Rose and puts his arm around her 
           shoulders
    
                                       PHIL
                  Who knew that when I started working in the 
                  finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also 
                  find the light of my life.
    
                                       ROSE
                  Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah 
                  look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil 
                  will you help Vada get settled?
    
                                       PHIL
                  Come on...I'll show you where you're gonna 
                  stay.
    
           Vada and Phil go upstairs, and enter a very nicely done up 
           room
    
                                       PHIL
                  Here we go...not what you expected from 
                  downstairs right? Now well put your stuff over 
                  here in this closet...you can unpack later and 
                  this is where you sleep. Luckily this sofa bed 
                  is really comfortable, I can tell you that 
                  from personal experience.
    
                         (pointing)
                  Bathroom, do you have to?
                         (pointing)
                  Rose and my room.
    
                                       VADA
                  She lives here too?
    
                                       PHIL
                  Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. 
                  This is Nick's room and uhh....
    
                                       VADA
                  But...are you engaged or something?
    
                                       PHIL
                  Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, 
                  want something to drink? Sure you do, it's 
                  been a long trip.
    
           Phil goes and begins to get Vada a drink
    
                  You see Vada, marriage, marriage is a very 
                  big step...and...no... not something to be 
                  entered into lightly, see I just uhh...I just 
                  wanna make very sure that everything is 
                  absolutely right before I go jumping into some 
                  kind of a...
    
                                       VADA
                  Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, 
                  Uncle Phil.
    
                                       PHIL
                  That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what 
                  do you call it?
    
                                       VADA
                  Committed?
    
                                       PHIL
                  Committed.
    
                                       VADA
                  So does that mean that you sleep here every 
                  night?
    
                                       PHIL
                  Yes, it does.
    
           Phil holds up two containers, one of orange juice and one 
           of milk, Vada
    
                  indicates the milk
    
                                       VADA
                  Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
    
                                       PHIL
                  Vada, I know that traditionally you're not 
                  supposed to do a lot of these things before 
                  you're officially married...but these are 
                  very, very special circumstances.
    
           Phil pours Vada a drink of milk, as she drinks it we 
           hear...
    
                                       VADA'S THOUGHTS
                  When sex is involved, it's always special 
                  circumstances.
    
           AT THE ZSIGMOND DINNING TABLE. ROSE, PHIL, VADA AND NICK 
           ARE SITTING, EATING
    
                                       VADA
                  My parents had a brief, but intensely 
                  fulfilling relationship. She's remained a 
                  woman of mystery to this day.
    
                                       NICK
                  And you're gonna solve the mystery?
    
                                       VADA
                  I got it all figured out, I know she went to 
                  Wilson High School, so first thing tomorrow, 
                  I'm gonna go there and get a copy of her 
                  yearbook. That way I can get the names of all 
                  the people she was in clubs with and found out 
                  who her friends were.
    
                                       PHIL
                  Then you'll be all set.
    
                                       ROSE
                  Sounds like you're very organized.
    
                                       VADA
                  I had to be, I only have five days. So just 
                  point me in the right direction and....
    
                                       PHIL
                  I'll do better than that. I'll send you off 
                  with your own private guide.
    
           Phil looks at Nick
    
                                       NICK
                         (mouth full)
                  Muh??
    
                                       PHIL
                  I'd consider it a personal favor.
    
           Nick flashes an evil look at Vada
    
           VADA IS IN A DRESSING GOWN, WALKING TOWARD THE KITCHEN 
           WHERE NICK AND PHIL ARE WASHING DISHES AND TALKING, VADA 
           STOPS BEHIND THE FRIDGE AND LISTENS
    
                                       PHIL
                  It's not like you had a whole lot planned for 
                  this week right? It'll be okay. Hey, here you 
                  go. 
           Phil hands               10 to Nick
    
                                       NICK
                  What's that?
    
                                       PHIL
                  Ten bucks.
    
                                       NICK
                  What's it for?
    
                                       PHIL
                  For the mini-bike fund.
    
                                       NICK
                  Wow!
    
                                       PHIL
                  Well I know you're not crazy about taking 
                  Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to 
                  know I appreciate it though.
    
                                       NICK
                  No problem.
    
                                       PHIL
                  You're a good man Nicholas.
    
                                       NICK
                  Phil, I think you should consider...
           fades as Vada walks off
    
           CLOSE UP OF VADA IN BED. SHE WAKES UP, AND GETS UP, 
           WANDERING OUT ONTO THE FRONT PORCH IN THE FRESH MORNING AIR 
           LOOKING AT LA
    
           EXTERNAL VIEW OF BUS GOING DOWN A HIGHWAY
    
           INSIDE BUS, VADA AND NICK ARE SITTING ON ONE OF THE SEATS
    
                                       VADA
                  I thought my mom went to school in LA, we've 
                  gotta be closing in on the Grand Canyon. But 
                  I'm sure for a trip to the Grand Canyon you'd 
                  charge a little more than...ten dollars.
    
           Nick ponders on this for a moment and then looks annoyed
    
                                       NICK
                  You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive 
                  habit.
    
                                       VADA
                  I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
    
                                       NICK
                  I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it 
                  to me.
    
                                       VADA
                  Well look, I know that all you care about is 
                  your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have 
                  no sense of historical perspective, I think 
                  we're here.
    
           she pulls the buzzer
    
                                       NICK
                         (to driver)
                  Getting off please.
    
                                       VADA
                  Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
    
           Vada and Nick get off the bus and walk towards an empty 
           field, there is a plaque standing near them, so Vada goes to 
           look
    
                                       VADA
                  Where's the school?
    
           looks at the plaque and reads from it
    
                                       VADA
                  Due to a devastating fire June 17 1963, 
                  Wilson High School was closed.
    
                  I can't believe it! My mother's high school 
                  burned down!

                                       SAM
                  Mostly...little babies, but...not 
                  exclusively.
    
           Phil looks up from his work to see Sam holding Rose's 
           hands, he is mildly annoyed
    
                                       SAM
                         (laughing)
                  ...It's all in the hands really. You know you 
                  have nice hands, you operate?
    
                                       ROSE
                         (laughing)
                  Yes, I do.
    
                                       SAM
                  ...so I guess I'll always...teach...you 
                  know...'cause it makes a good relief from the 
                  operating-room, I feel I have an obligation...
    
           Rose and Sam continue conversing as Phil comes over to them
    
                                       PHIL
                  Hi, Phil Sultenfuss
    
           Phil goes to shake Sam's hand and then realizes that they 
           are very dirty and
    
                  withdraws his hand Oh sorry. Ahh, some kind 
                  of problem here?
    
                                       ROSE
                  No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just 
                  needs to have his oil changed.
    
                                       PHIL
                  Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require 
                  such a lengthy consultation.
    
                                       SAM
                  Well Rose was being very thorough.
    
                                       PHIL
                  Was Rose.
    
                                       ROSE
                  Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in 
                  tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when 
                  we open, we'll get you started.
    
                                       SAM
                  I'll be here.
    
                                       PHIL
                  I look forward to it. 
           Phil slaps the windscreen of Sam's car, leaving a huge 
           greasy handprint 
    
                  Oh, I'm sorry, I'll get that for you in the 
                  morning.
    
           he gets out a rag and wipes the mark, smearing it 
                  Ooooh, made it worse, Get that for you in the 
                  morning. Nice wheels.
    
                                       SAM
                  Thanks.
    
           Sam reverses out and drives off
    
                                       PHIL
                  What's with the touching, why was he touching 
                  you?
    
                                       ROSE
                  He wasn't touching me he was 
                  just...gesturing...
    
                                       PHIL
                  He was caressing.
    
                                       ROSE
                  Phil for God sake.
    
                                       PHIL
                  God? No I didn't think you'd want to invoke 
                  God Rose, because he saw even more than I did.  
                  ROSE
                  Look Phil, if you want the rights of a 
                  husband, you're gonna have to ask me something 
                  but if not, you're gonna have to get 
                  accustomed to the rights of what you are.
    
                                       PHIL
                  Oh...what's that?
    
                                       ROSE
                  Right now? An intimate border 
                  with...mechanical skills.
    
           Phil notices Nick and Vada entering the garage
    
                                       PHIL
                  Hi!
    
                                       ROSE
                  Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
    
                                       NICK
                  Just call us the "dead end kids".
    
                                       VADA
                  May I use the phone please.
    
                                       ROSE
                  Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
    
                                       PHIL
                  Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A 
                  gentleman, would choose British racing green, 
                  with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a 
                  red car, with a black interior and wire 
                  wheels, you have one thing on your mind and 
                  one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman 
                  to say what that one thing is...in front of 
                  the children.
    
           Vada and Nick exchange looks
    
                  Even if I am just a glorified boarder.
    
           Phil changes the radio station from the classical one that 
           Rose has it on,
    
                  to a modern one, with some heavy 70's music 
                  on it
    
           Vada is talking on the phone trying to find the number for 
           another one
    
                  of her mother's friends
    
                                       VADA
                  Hi, I would like the number of Stanley 
                  Rosenfeld photos, please?
    
           IN A BALL ROOM, HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARE DANCING TO A SONG 
           BEING PLAYED BY A LIVE BAND, VADA AND NICK ARE WALKING WITH

                  You know photography is an art form if you 
                  take it seriously enough, which I happen to 
                  do. 
           Stanley sees a couple dancing

                  for the birdie. Hold, hold.

                                       STANLEY
                  Thank YOU.
    
           Vada and Nick exchange weird looks
    
                  Your mother was something-special Vada, to 
                  tell you the truth, I had quite a crush on 
                  her.
    
                                       VADA
                  Really?
    
                                       STANLEY
                  Who didn't? She could play basketball like 
                  Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then 
                  she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, 
                  forget about it. I asked her out a couple of 
                  times but she always said no.
    
                  Lenny, Nancy, you just got married, look 
                  happy, look happy, look like you mean it.

                  I remember those days, then we all went off 
                  to UCLA and she started hanging round with 
                  those drama department types. There was this 
                  one guy, Peter Webb he's become a big director 
                  in Hollywood now...and the only reason I know 
                  him at all is that we were all together in 
                  this big poetry class with this crazy guy 
                  Albert Boderfelder...
    
                                       VADA
                  Beidermeyer?
    
                                       STANLEY
                  Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
    
                                       VADA
                  He's a great poet.
    
                                       STANLEY
                  He is?
    
                                       VADA
                  Do you know him?
    
                                       STANLEY
                  Everybody did, walk along Citrus between 
                  Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.
    
                                       VADA
                  He'll remember my mother for sure.  STANLEY
                  It was a big class Vada and...but...well of 
                  course he'll remember, who could forget 
                  Maggie?
    
                                       VADA
                  Just one more thing. Does this mean anything 
                  to you?
    
           Vada gets out the brown paper bag and shows it to Stanley
    
                                       STANLEY
                  No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.
    
                                       VADA
                  Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and 
                  I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, 
                  I'm sure she would have had a really great 
                  time.
    
                                       STANLEY
                  I would have tried to show her a good time. I 
                  promised her when she left that I would never 
                  forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld 
                  does not forget.
    
           VADA AND NICK ARE WALKING DOWN A PAVEMENT, TALKING

                  This is the street he walks down every day.

                  Boy, you're really into this.

                  He is one of the great poets.
    
           they look across the road and see an old man sitting in a 
           chair, writing
    
                                       VADA

                  glitter. She'd talent, God knows that face was 
                  made for close-ups but everything was...magic 
                  with Maggie. I remember, we were walking down 
                  Hollywood Boulevard, we put our feet in the
    
                  stars' footprints, you know like tourists do, 
                  Maggie could not believe it, her feet were the 
                  same size as Judy Garland. Of course mine 
                  matched perfectly with Orson Wells. Hahaha, 
                  just kidding.
    
                  You should call Hillary Mitchell...Maggie 
                  were very close. She's got this funky little 
                  clothing store over here on Melrose, I'd call 
                  her for you but well we ahh, kinda had this 
                  thing you know...got a little messy.

                  Well not really. Ahh, could be the date of an 
                  opening, an audition...eh...umm...birthday? 
                  Not my birthday. I dunno, who...eh...writes 
                  dates on paper bags?

                                       ROSE
                         (to Nick, whom she gives a kiss on 
                         the forehead)
                  You're so clever.
    
                         (to Vada)
                  Are you all right honey?
    
                                       VADA
                  I'm just tired.
    
                                       ROSE
                  All right, well get to bed early and don't 
                  let anybody in. Bye.
    
                                       PHIL
                  Lock the door.
    
                                       VADA
                  Bye.
    
           Vada looks up expectantly at Nick, who gets up and goes to 
           the door to check
    
                  that Rose and Phil have left
    
                                       NICK
                  We have lift off.
    
           the song "Bennie and the Jets" begins to play
    
           ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD, NICK AND VADA ARE LOOKING AT ALL 
           THE STARS ON THE PAVEMENT
    
                                       VADA
                  Joan Crawford, oh I love her...there's the 
                  Marx Brothers. Carol Lombard, my dad's 
                  favorite!
    
                                       NICK
                  Never heard of her.

                  Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.

                  Here's Judy Garland!
    
           Vada runs over
    
                                       VADA
                  My mother stood on this very spot.
    
                                       NICK
                  I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
    
                                       VADA
                  That's 'cause I was cursed with the 
                  Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
    
                                       NICK
                  Big deal.
    
           A hippie walks past smoking a joint, and blows a puff of it 
           on Vada, who
    
                  smells it and coughs
    
                                       VADA
                  What's he smoking?
    
                                       NICK
                  What do you think?
    
                                       VADA
                  Really?
    
           Vada starts off after him, but Nick grabs her arm and pulls 
           her away, they
    
                  walk off and then Vada sees a sign saying 
                  Ears Pierced,               5.00
    
                                       VADA
                  Hey look!
    
                                       NICK
                  This is a totally barbaric custom.
    
           They enter the store
    
           VADA AND NICK STROLLING QUIETLY DOWN A PAVEMENT IN FRONT OF 
           A LARGE WALL MURAL OF MOVIE STARS
    
                                       NICK
                  So if Phil marries my mom, she'd be your Aunt 
                  right?
    
                                       VADA
                  Right.
    
                                       NICK
                  And you'd be my cousin?
    
                                       VADA
                  Yeah I guess...sort of.
    
                                       NICK
                  But we wouldn't really be related right?
    
                                       VADA
                  Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same 
                  bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total 
                  strangers who...accidentally had relatives 
                  that got married.
    
                                       NICK
                  Good. I mean...
    
                                       VADA
                  Marriage can really complicate things. So, 
                  aren't you gonna say anything about my 
                  earrings?
    
                                       NICK
                  I already did, it's a totally barbaric 
                  custom...but on you, it looks good.
    
           Vada smiles
    
           BUS PULLS UP TO STOP NEAR BUDAPEST AUTO REPAIRS, NICK AND 
           VADA RUN OFF OF IT AND SPRINT OFF TOWARDS THE DOOR TO NICK'S 
           HOUSE
    
                                       VADA
                  We should've called.

                  It's not that late!
    
           they enter the living room, Rose and Phil are sitting 
           waiting
    
                                       ROSE
                  You're grounded 'till you're fifty!

                  You're over reacting!

                  Make that sixty and I'm docking your 
                  allowance for two weeks.

                  MOM!
    
                                       ROSE
                  You think this is easy for me? You go out on 
                  the town and I get to be the bad guy. Look I 
                  don't want you to be some punk hoodlum 
                  delinquent but I can't do my job as a parent 
                  if you don't do your job as a kid.
    
                                       VADA
                  It's not his fault!
    
                                       NICK
                  No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, 
                  ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do 
                  anything.
    
                                       ROSE
                  Go to your room.
                         (to Vada)
                  And you...I don't suppose your father gave 
                  you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
    
                                       VADA
                  Not exactly.
    
                                       ROSE
                  Well just don't shave your legs...he'll never 
                  let you visit us again if I send you home 
                  hairless and full of holes.
    
           Phil moves his hand up to cover his smile as he tries 
           desperately not to laugh
    
           GARAGE DAY, DR HELBURN DRIVES IN
    
                                       SAM
                  Good morning.
    
                                       ROSE
                  Well maybe for you.
    
                                       SAM
                  Something wrong?
    
                                       ROSE
                  Well let's just say you're lucky you deal 
                  with children who are under anesthesia.
    
                                       SAM
                  Well, even without anesthesia I always tell 
                  my patients to...eh... to relax.
    
                  Look...eh...isn't it time for your coffee 
                  break or something? There must be some place 
                  we can go...talk?
    
                                       ROSE
                  Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.
    
                                       SAM
                  You couldn't?
    
                                       ROSE
                  Well I'm sort of involved.
    
                                       SAM
                  Sort of?
    
                                       ROSE
                  Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
    
                                       SAM
                  Where I come from, involvement...generally 
                  calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
    
                                       ROSE
                  Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
    
                                       SAM
                  All right, so you don't like jewelry 
                  but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. 
                  Liszt, one of my favorites.
    
                                       ROSE
                  Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were 
                  Hungarian.
    
                                       SAM
                  Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful 
                  music...and beautiful women.
    
           Phil approaches, looking annoyed
    
                                       PHIL
                  Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last 
                  couple of days we've changed your oil, 
                  realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated 
                  your tires, aligned your front end, and 
                  flushed out your entire cooling system, I 
                  really didn't expect to be seeing you for 
                  another three thousand miles.
    
                                       SAM
                  Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel 
                  so welcome here.
    
                                       ROSE
                  And you are.
    
           Phil glances at Rose
    
                                       SAM
                  Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the 
                  morning and you can check out that left 
                  blinker for me.
    
                                       ROSE
                  Oh, sure okay.
    
                                       SAM
                  I'll see you then...I look forward to it.
    
           Sam gets into his car and drives off
    
                                       PHIL
                  You really oughtta flush out that line of 
                  bullshit he's got:
    
                  Hungarian's are famous for their beautiful 
                  women.
    
                                       ROSE
                  What's wrong with a little flattery? What's 
                  wrong with a little appreciation?
    
           Rose starts to move toward the office
    
                                       PHIL
                  Wait, are you saying that I don't appreciate?
    
                                       ROSE
                  I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a 
                  real date, when was the last time you did 
                  that?
    
                                       PHIL
                  Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every 
                  night.
    
                                       ROSE
                  No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't 
                  cook.
    
           Rose shuts the door
    
                                       PHIL
                  I do the dishes.

                  I'd go to a fortuneteller but they can only

                  Ooh...of course!

                  gone...she'll never get to see how well you've 
                  turned out. Oh... oh my God...Maggie! You poor

                                       VADA
                  It's okay really, I was just a baby.
    
                                       HILLARY
                  I'm sorry, it's just...I've been taking all 
                  these seminars to get in touch with my 
                  feelings and...sometimes it gets out of hand.
    
           Nick reaches over and gets a tissue, then hands it to 
           Hillary
    
                                       NICK
                  Here.
    
                                       HILLARY
                  Oh, thank you, you're very sweet. So how did 
                  you find out where I was?
    
                                       NICK
                  Peter Webb told us.
    
                                       HILLARY
                  Peter? You saw Peter? Oh God...
                         (begins to cry, and then hugs Nick)
    
                  Oh forgive me, I'm making such a scene here. 
                  Why don't you have a seat.
    
                                       VADA
                  Thanks.
    
                                       HILLARY
                  I remember Maggie...and your Dad too, you 
                  know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford 
                  pickup. "Chuck the Truck" we used to call it.
    
                  It was pitch black, with a red leather 
                  interior. Does he still drive that?
    
                                       VADA
                  No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.
    
                                       NICK
                  He's an undertaker.
    
                                       HILLARY
                  You're kidding, Jeffrey Pommeroy's an 
                  undertaker?
    
           Vada and Nick are confused
    
                                       VADA
                  His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
    
                                       HILLARY
                  Oh.
                         (then it dawns on her)
                  Ohhh?
    
                                       VADA
                  What're you saying?
    
                                       HILLARY
                  Ummmmm, look, I...I...
    
                                       VADA
                  Are you saying my mother had another husband?
    
                                       HILLARY
                  Oh honey, back then...people did crazy 
                  things.
    
                                       VADA
                  They sure did! They got kicked out of school, 
                  they married truck drivers...these are my 
                  mother's greatest accomplishments? I'm sure 
                  glad I came all the way out here to find them 
                  out.
    
           Vada runs out of store, Nick looks at Hillary and then 
           follows
    
           OUTSIDE ON SIDEWALK
    
           Vada is running down the sidewalk
    
                                       NICK
                  Vada, wait up!
    
           Vada slows down and Nick catches up
    
                  Just because you mother was married before, 
                  it...it doesn't mean anything.
    
                                       VADA
                         (very near tears)
                  Maybe not...but maybe it does. If no one told 
                  me about this, I mean...maybe they're trying 
                  to hide something.
    
                                       NICK
                  Like what?
    
                                       VADA
                  Maybe this Jeffrey guy is...is my real 
                  father. I mean...look at me, I have the hair 
                  of a dead person and...and my nose, no one in 
                  my family has this nose, it could be the nose 
                  of...a...of a complete stranger,
    
           Vada's voice is getting a little hysterical and she is 
           starting to cry
    
                  I mean...I came out here to...to find out 
                  about my mother and I...and I found...
    
           Vada turns around, covers her face and cries
    
                                       NICK
                  Don't cry...come on...that lady in there 
                  looked pretty flaky to me.
    
                  How 'bout Phil, maybe he knows something 
                  about all this. At least you should talk to 
                  him before you get worked up.
    
                                       VADA
                  Before I get worked up? You don't think this 
                  is worked up?
    
           Nick takes Vada by the shoulders and gently turns her 
           around, he then wipes
    
                  a tear from her cheek
    
                                       NICK
                  That thing you said about your nose...it was 
                  a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I 
                  mean...it's yours...you know?
    
                                       VADA
                  Nick?
    
                                       NICK
                  Yeah?
    
                                       VADA
                  This has been a real confusing day.
    
           Nick nods
    
           ZSIGMOND DINING ROOM TABLE, VADA, PHIL, NICK AND ROSE ARE 
           SITTING EATING
    
                                       VADA
                  How could Dad let me visit here and find out 
                  like this?
    
           Phil shrugs
    
                                       VADA
                  I'm gonna call him...and make him tell me 
                  everything.
    
           Phil knows something that Vada doesn't, and he doesn't want 
           Vada to phone
    
                  Harry at the moment
    
                                       PHIL
                  Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou...
    
                                       VADA
                  Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.
    
           Vada picks up the phone and dials a number
    
                                       HARRY
                  Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.
    
                                       VADA
                  Hi Dad.
    
                                       HARRY
                  Hi honey.
    
                                       VADA
                  I just called to say that I'm having a really 
                  great time.
    
                                       HARRY
                  Good! You should go over and watch some Ted 
                  Carson.
    
                                       VADA
                  Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
    
           HARRY AND SHELLY'S ROOM BACK IN PENNSYLVANIA, SHELLY IS 
           LYING IN BED LOOKING SICK, HARRY IS SITTING BESIDE HER ON 
           THE PHONE TO VADA
    
                                       HARRY
                  Is he...eh...some kind of a new rock star or 
                  something?
    
           VADA
    
                                       VADA
                  Yeah.
    
                                       HARRY
                  Totally groovy huh?
    
                                       VADA
                  Totally.
    
           HARRY
    
                                       HARRY
                  Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
    
           VADA
    
                                       VADA
                  I will. How's Shelly?
    
           HARRY
    
                                       HARRY
                  Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor 
                  just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a 
                  little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just 
                  to make sure that...
    
           VADA
    
                                       VADA
                  Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
    
           HARRY
    
                                       HARRY
                  I love you too sweetie, bye.
    
                                       VADA
                  Give my love to Shelly.
    
           Harry hangs up and then looks at Shelly who has just opened 
           her eyes, and is weakly smiling a little
    
           VADA
    
                                       VADA
                  Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom 
                  of this whole thing and get back there.
    
                                       ROSE
                  She'll be all right baby.
    
                                       VADA
                  Yeah...right, it's pointless to worry.
    
           L.A.P.D. AGAIN, VADA AND NICK ARE TALKING TO DARYL TANAKA
    
                                       DARYL
                  I'm not authorized to trace licenses for 
                  civilians.
    
                                       VADA
                  His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to 
                  drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red 
                  interior. Please?
    
                                       NICK
                  Give us a break. All you have to do is make a 
                  phone call.
    
                                       DARYL
                         (to Vada)
                  I thought I told you to lose this guy.
    
                                       NICK
                  Look, sergeant I know I said some things last 
                  time that I shouldn't have said at all but...
    
                                       DARYL
                  I think the phrase was "Sleazoid Geek".
    
                                       NICK
                  I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy 
                  because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell 
                  her stuff that no one else knows.
    
                                       DARYL
                  You're still asking me to break the law.
    
                                       VADA
                  No, we're asking you to stand up with Maggie 
                  Muldovan like you should have years ago.
    
           Daryl thinks for a moment then picks up the phone and dials 
           a number
    
                                       DARYL
                  Yeah, this is Sergeant Tanaka from Holenbeck, 
                  I need a current address for a Jeffrey....
    
                                       VADA
                  Pommeroy.
    
                                       DARYL
                  Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a 
                  black 54 Ford Pickup.
                         (covers phone)
                  Monday.
    
                                       VADA
                         (disappointed)
                  I'm leaving Sunday.
    
                                       DARYL
                         (into phone)
                  Could you hold on for a second?
                         (quietly, to Vada and Nick)
    
                  Look, I can't get priority without a criminal 
                  charge.
    
                                       NICK
                  So charge him with something...who's gonna 
                  know?
    
                                       DARYL
                  Me, I'll know!
    
                                       VADA
                  Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?
    
                                       DARYL
                         (into phone)
                  Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this 
                  guy...well we think he might be going after 
                  the governor.
                         (pause)
                  Twenty minutes? Fine.
    
           BUDAPEST GARAGE, VADA AND PHIL ARE LOOKING AT THE ENGINE OF 
           A CAR
    
                                       PHIL
                  So give him a call, the worst he can do is 
                  hang up on you, right?
    
                                       VADA
                  I feel like before I can talk to him I have 
                  to see his face.
    
                                       PHIL
                  How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive 
                  over to his place, you can introduce 
                  yourself....
    
                                       VADA
                  I'd like to see his house but...I don't know 
                  if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock 
                  on his door. I don't think I can go through 
                  with it.
    
                                       PHIL
                  Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
    
           VADA AND PHIL DRIVING DOWN HIGHWAY, THEY TURN OFF INTO A 
           SIDE ROAD
    
                                       PHIL
                  You're awfully quiet.
    
                                       VADA
                  Do you think I should tell my dad about 
                  Jeffrey Pommeroy?
    
                                       PHIL
                  I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his 
                  mind right now.
    
                  Maybe some day when the time is right.
    
                                       VADA
                  Maybe.
    
                                       PHIL
                  Then again, your dad's got his own memories 
                  and he's got his own life now...I think this 
                  is a secret just between you and your mom.
    
                                       VADA
                  A secret, I like that.

                                       PHIL
                  This is it I guess.
    
                                       VADA
                  Well, I've come this far...the least I can do 
                  is knock on the door.
    
                                       PHIL
                  You want me to come with?
    
                                       VADA
                         (shakes her head)
                  I should do this myself.
    
                                       PHIL
                  Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a 
                  walk around.
    
                                       VADA
                  Okay.
    
           Vada gets out and makes her way up to the front door, 
           petting the dog sitting
    
                  on the doorstep, she turns to look back at 
                  Phil
    
                                       PHIL
                         (in car, gesturing that she should 
                         press the bell)
                  Go ahead honey...go ahead.
    
           Vada presses door bell, waits then presses it again, then a 
           man opens the door
    
                                       MAN
                  Hi there...can I help you?
    
                                       VADA
                  Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
    
                                       JEFFREY
                  Sure am, who are you?
    
                                       VADA
                  I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother 
                  was...
    
                                       JEFFREY
                  Maggie...Maggie's little girl.
    
           Vada nods
    
                                       JEFFREY
                  I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
    
                                       VADA
                  You mean, you knew about me?
    
                                       VOICE FROM INSIDE
                  Who is it honey?
    
           A woman appears next to Jeffrey
    
                                       JEFFREY
                  It's aah...Maggie's little girl, Vada.
    
                  WOMAN
                  Ohh, Oh my.
    
                                       JEFFREY
                  This is my wife Emily.
    
                                       EMILY
                  Hi.
    
                                       VADA
                  Hi.
    
                                       JEFFREY
                  Umm...can you come in for a minute?
    
                                       VADA
                  I'd like to, thanks.
    
           they enter the house. Vada walks next to Jeffrey who leads 
           them into the living room, a little girl suddenly comes 
           running in
    
                                       LITTLE GIRL
                  Mommy, Daddy, I painted you a rainbow, come 
                  and see.
    
                                       EMILY
                         (to Katie)
                  This is Vada,
                         (to Vada)
                  Vada this is our little girl Katie.
    
                                       VADA
                  Hi.
    
                                       KATIE
                         (shy)
                  Hi.
    
                                       EMILY
                  Umm...why don't we let Daddy and Vada visit 
                  for a little while?
    
                                       KATIE
                  Okay.
    
                                       JEFFREY
                  Okay.
    
                                       KATIE
                  Bye.
    
                                       VADA
                  Bye.
                         (Emily and Katie leave)
                  She looks a little like me when I was a 
                  little girl.
    
                                       JEFFREY
                  Does she?
    
           Vada nods
    
                                       JEFFREY
                  I'm glad you're here.
    
                                       VADA
                  You are?
    
                                       JEFFREY
                  Yeah, come on, let's talk.
    
           they move into the kitchen
    
           IN KITCHEN, JEFFREY IS IN FRIDGE GETTING A DRINK
    
                                       VADA
                  We have this school assignment to write about 
                  someone we never met and I chose my mother. 
                  She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle 
                  Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and 
                  then I looked at her high school yearbook 
                  and...  and I called a few people and one guy 
                  said that she went to UCLA, another guy said 
                  that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
    
                                       JEFFREY
                  Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
    
                                       VADA
                  Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. 
                  Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford 
                  truck and this policeman I know got in touch 
                  with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your 
                  address and here I am.
    
                                       JEFFREY
                         (laughs)
    
                                       VADA
                  I told you it was a long story.
    
                                       JEFFREY
                  That's all right, you know what? You sound 
                  just sounded just like your mother...she told 
                  great stories. Stories with crazy accents 
                  and...special effects.
    
                                       VADA
                  Special effects?
    
                                       JEFFREY
                  Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when 
                  she was talking about lightning...audiences 
                  love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to 
                  work an audience.
    
                                       VADA
                  I don't know very much about her...I was 
                  hoping that you could help me.
    
                                       JEFFREY
                  I'll try.
    
           Vada gets out her brown paper bag and hands it to JEFFREY
    
                                       VADA
                  No one else knows what this means.
    
           JEFFREY looks at it for a moment as memories come flooding 
           back
    
                                       JEFFREY
                  You see...the thing is, we always wanted to 
                  work in a theater, so we drove out to New 
                  York, to Broadway where it was...where it was 
                  all happening...and...New York was just full 
                  of fancy French restaurants and we wanted to 
                  get married in one but we were totally broke, 
                  so your mom found this little coffee 
                  shop...little tables round the back...and real 
                  tablecloths on 'em, and a minister who worked 
                  cheap...but when we got down to the coffee 
                  shop there was a sign on the door that said 
                  Closed by the Board of Health. By that time 
                  it had started snowing, so...we just got 
                  married...right outside in the snow.
    
                  It was freezing but it was wonderful. And for 
                  our wedding feast, we had a bag of hot roasted 
                  chestnuts. This is the bag.
    
                                       VADA
                  And she saved it.
    
                                       JEFFREY
                         (nods)
                  Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just 
                  wrote the date on the bag and said, "This will 
                  be out wedding album, this will be a day we 
                  will never forget." We never did.
    
                                       VADA
                  Do you have any pictures if her?
    
                                       JEFFREY
                  I've got something better.
    
           ROOM WITH PROJECTOR SITTING BEHIND COUCH, VADA IS SEATED ON 
           THE COUCH AND JEFFREY IS SITTING BEHIND HER OPERATING IT
    
           Vada and JEFFREY are watching the movie
    
                                       JEFFREY
                  We called ourselves "The Appearing Nightly 
                  Players".
    
                                       MAGGIE
                         (on screen, in French accent)
                  Darling, oh where is my chauffeur? You don't 
                  want I should walk to the stage? An actress of 
                  my overwhelming talent?
    
                                       VADA
                  She's beautiful.
    
                                       JEFFREY
                  We performed on the beach one 
                  summer...ha...everything went wrong.
    
           we can see the acting troupe stuffing round on the beach, 
           then Maggie in a doughnut-floatie in the sea with an 
           umbrella, then playing volleyball, then sitting at a table 
           surrounded by friends, she is convinced to sing by her 
           friends, which she begins to do
    
                                       MAGGIE
    
                  Smile though your heart is aching,
    
                  Smile, even though it's breaking,
    
                  When there are clouds,
    
                  In the sky you'll get by,
    
                  If you smile through your fears and sorrows,
    
                  Smile and maybe tomorrow,
    
                  You'll see the sun come shining through if 
                  you,
    
                  Light up your face with gladness,
    
                  Hide every trace of sadness,
    
                  Although a tear may be ever so near,
    
                  That's the time you must keep on trying,
    
                  Smile, what's the use of crying,
    
                  You'll find that life is still worthwhile,
    
                  If you just smile.
    
           the group that Maggie sang for start to complement her and 
           chatter away, then the reel ends, JEFFREY turns off the 
           projector, gets up and turns on the light

                  She had a...a beautiful voice.
    
           Vada nods, crying a little
    
                                       JEFFREY
                  Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
    
                                       VADA
                         (turns around)
                  More than anything in the world.
    
                                       JEFFREY
                         (nods)
                  It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
    
                                       VADA
                  Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
    
                                       JEFFREY
                  Well I didn't know about you until after she 
                  was gone.
    
                                       VADA
                  I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious 
                  about how I turned out.
    
                                       JEFFREY
                  I'd say you turned out just fine.
    
                                       VADA
                  I guess what I mean is, my mother married my 
                  dad after you...and then I was born, so I 
                  thought that...maybe you got divorced because 
                  of me.
    
                                       JEFFREY
                  Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you 
                  think I'm your father?
    
                                       VADA
                  Well...
    
                                       JEFFREY
                  Honey I'd be proud to be your father, really. 
                  It just isn't so.
    
           they walk outside
    
                                       JEFFREY
                  Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I 
                  didn't.
    
                                       VADA
                  oh.
    
                                       JEFFREY
                  She didn't wanna miss out on 
                  anything...especially motherhood...it got to 
                  be a real problem with us.
    
                  I thought she had plenty of time, she didn't. 
                  Anyway...that's why I was grateful when she 
                  met your father, he had the sense to love her 
                  the way she deserved...and most of all...I was 
                  glad that she had you, the baby she always 
                  wanted.
    
                  I wanted you to know that.
    
           this has made Vada's day, she looks very happy, they hug 
           each other
    
           BUDAPEST GARAGE, VADA IS TALKING TO NICK, ROSE AND PHIL
    
                                       VADA
                  And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my 
                  report. Jeffrey says audiences love special 
                  effects.
    
                                       NICK
                  You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole 
                  vacation.
    
                                       ROSE
                  Well it's a wonderful story with a very happy 
                  ending.
    
           Sam enters the garage in his car
    
                                       PHIL
                  Sorry doc, we close for business at 3 o'clock 
                  today.
    
           Sam gets out and walks over to Rose, and offers Rose a box
    
                                       SAM
                  Ahh...this isn't business. You know I...I 
                  found this wonderful little Hungarian 
                  restaurant that makes it's own strudel and 
                  I...I thought you might like a taste of the 
                  old country. You see there's apple in there 
                  and...and cherry and this is the...eh... 
                  cheese but I...I gotta say I think that cherry 
                  is...is really....
    
           Phil grabs the strudel and puts it back in Sam's car
    
                                       PHIL
                  Okay, that does it, that does it, the strudel 
                  does it, first it's brakes then.... I mean I 
                  am not gonna let some Podiatrist with a Jaguar 
                  full of strudel come waltzing in here and....
    
                                       SAM
                  I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
    
                                       PHIL
                  Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an 
                  arrangement.
    
                                       SAM
                  Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?
    
                                       ROSE
                  Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very 
                  interested to know what kind of an arrangement 
                  we have.
    
                                       PHIL
                  You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on 
                  Rose...what do you want from me?
    
                                       ROSE
                  I don't want anything you don't wanna give 
                  me.
    
                                       SAM
                  And you certainly shouldn't settle for 
                  anything less that you deserve.
    
                                       PHIL
                  You stay out of this, look, if I had a red 
                  XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell 
                  wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.
    
                                       SAM
                  I don't think the color of the interior 
                  is....
    
                                       PHIL
                  Rose this not the place to be having this...
    
                                       ROSE
                  I think this place is just fine.
    
                                       PHIL
                  You know how I feel about you.
    
                                       ROSE
                  You like the way I cook...you think I make 
                  out a great invoice.  PHIL
                  You and Nick and...and this...this garage are 
                  my whole life...I love you. Sure you don't 
                  have the greatest taste in music...but there's 
                  not another woman who could look so sexy in 
                  that smock. What I'm try... what I'm trying to 
                  sa...
    
           Vada takes Phil's hand and mouths the word "commitment" to 
           him, giving him strength
    
                  What I mean to say...Rose will you marry me?
    
                                       ROSE
                  You really think I look sexy in this smock?
    
                                       PHIL
                  Is that a yes?
    
           Phil and Rose hug each other and kiss, Sam looks defeated, 
           Vada and Nick smile at each other
    
           AT AIRPORT, VADA IS ABOUT TO BOARD HER PLANE, ROSE AND PHIL 
           ARE STANDING NEXT TO HER
    
                                       VADA
                  Thanks for everything, you're the best.
    
                                       PHIL
                  No, you're the best and I don't want you 
                  talking to anybody on the plane.
    
                                       VADA
                  Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna 
                  meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some 
                  pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with 
                  Shelly.
    
                                       PHIL
                  Sounds great, well you give 'em both one of 
                  these for me.
    
           Phil gives Vada hug and a kiss
    
                                       VADA
                  Bye Aunt Rose.
    
                                       ROSE
                  Bye Niece, Vada.
    
           Rose and Vada hug
    
                                       VADA
                  Thanks. Well, bye.
    
           Vada walks down the corridor a little and stops by Nick who 
           is waiting for her
    
                                       VADA
                  ...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to 
                  sacrifice your entire vacation.
    
                                       NICK
                  Some sacrifices are worth it.
    
                                       VADA
                  You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
    
                                       NICK
                  I wouldn't say it was terrible...it 
                  was...kind of...
    
                                       VADA
                  An adventure?
    
                                       NICK
                         (smiling)
                  Part adventure...part miracle.
    
           Nick looks into Vada's eyes, they kiss, a long moment 
           passes and their lips part. They both smile at each other
    
                                       NICK
                  Write me a poem?
    
                                       VADA
                         (shakes her head smiling)
    
                                       NICK
                  No?
    
                                       VADA
                  I'll write you ten poems.
                         (PA springs to life informing people 
                         to board NOW)
                  Bye.
    
                                       NICK
                  Good-bye, look in your backpack.
    
           Vada turns around and looks at Nick
    
                                       VADA
                  Okay.
    
           Vada walks down the passage and turns out of sight, Nick 
           turns and heads past Rose and Phil, his eyes fixated on some 
           object far away, there is only one word to describe how he 
           looks
                  STONED ON LOVE
    
           INSIDE PLANE, VADA IN HER SEAT, SHE REMOVES HER SEATBELT 
           AND OPENS HER BACKPACK
    
           she finds a little box which she opens and finds contained 
           in it a note and a pair of earrings, she looks at the 
           earrings and then reads the note
    
                                       VADA'S THOUGHTS
                         (reading note)
                  In memory of barbaric customs, Love Nick.
    
           this makes Vada extremely happy
    
                                       VADA'S THOUGHTS
                  Life is full of barbaric customs, I just hope 
                  they all end with a kiss like that.
    
           as Vada disembarks, she makes her way into the crowd of 
           people waiting to pick up others, Arthur is standing there 
           waiting, Vada approaches
    
                                       VADA
                  Arthur, where's my dad?
    
                                       ARTHUR
                  He took Shelly to the hospital.
    
                                       VADA
                  Is she okay?
    
                                       ARTHUR
                  Well, she was making a lot of noise.
    
           they exit the scene
    
           OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL, ARTHUR PULLS UP AND LETS VADA OUT
    
           Vada gets out of the car and runs inside, making her way 
           through corridors to the maternity ward, where Harry is 
           waiting
    
                                       VADA
                  Dad!
    
           Vada and Harry hug each other
    
                                       VADA
                  What happened to Shelly?
    
                                       HARRY
                  She just had a baby that's all.
    
                                       VADA
                         (excited)
                  We have a baby?
    
                                       HARRY
                  Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
    
                                       VADA
                  Can I see him?
    
                                       HARRY
                  You can do anything you want. You're his 
                  sister.
    
                  Hey, what's on your ear?
    
           VADA ENTERS THE ROOM WHERE SHELLY IS LYING HOLDING THE BABY
    
                                       VADA
                  Shelly?
    
                                       SHELLY
                  Hey! Oh look.
    
                                       VADA
                  He's so tiny.
    
                                       SHELLY
                  I know, look at his little hands.
    
                                       HARRY
                  I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.
    
                                       SHELLY
                  I was pushing as fast as I could.
    
                                       VADA
                  Did it hurt a lot?
    
                                       SHELLY
                  You have no idea.
    
                                       BABY
                  WAAAAAAAAAAH!!!
    
                                       SHELLY
                  Shhhh.
    
                                       VADA
                  Let me hold him.
    
                                       SHELLY
                  O.K.
    
           Vada gently takes the baby from Shelly's arms
    
                                       SHELLY
                  Maybe he's wet?
    
                                       HARRY
                  Maybe he's hungry.
    
                                       VADA
                  He's okay...you just have to sing to him.
    
                  "Smile though your heart is aching,
                  Smile, even though it's breaking,
                  Although a tear may be ever so near,
                  That's the time you must keep on trying,
                  Smile, what's the use of crying,
                  You'll find that life is still worthwhile,
                  If you just smile."
    
           OUTSIDE, HARRY SHELLY VADA AND BABY (IN PRAM) 
           ARE TAKING A WALK
    
                                       VADA'S THOUGHTS
                  Things haven't exactly calmed down around 
                  here, I got an A+ on the report, Dad's getting 
                  used to my pierced ears and Nick's coming to 
                  visit this summer. Other than that I'm busy 
                  being a big sister. I'd like to tell my 
                  brother about my mom, how I got to meet her 
                  friends and find out how special she was, I 
                  mean...she may not have her footprints in 
                  cement but she definitely left her imprint on 
                  the world...and I told them that even though 
                  it sounds conceited...her greatest achievement 
                  was me.
    
           Vada, Harry, Shelly and the baby cross the road and walk 
           off down the sidewalk as the camera rises and the song "My 
           Girl" begins to play and the credits roll
