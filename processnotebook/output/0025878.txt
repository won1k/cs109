                   EFFECT SHOT:  THE SHADOW OF THE THIN MAN!
    
                   The shadow, grotesquely thin, is cast by one strong light 
                   which reflects itself against a white cement wall.  When 
                   we first see the shad-ow, it is standing upright, examining 
                   some- thing which it holds in its hands.  Now the shadow 
                   bends down and as it does so, CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL 
                   CLYDE WYNANT in his work-shop.  He is a tall, thin man of 
                   about fifty-five, with white hair.  He has a fine, sensi- 
                   tive face.  He is a very successful inventor.
    
                   A man who is capable of sudden fits of anger which he 
                   forgets almost immediately, but which are quite terrifying 
                   while they last.  Just now he is utterly absorbed in what 
                   he is doing -- working on a delicately-wired part which 
                   has to do with a new form of combustion engine that he has 
                   invented.  (Through the entire scene, from the first shadow 
                   effect, we hear the engine in operation as he is working 
                   over it.)  Wynant is dressed in overalls, and possibly a 
                   long shade over his eyes.  The shop itself is in the base- 
                   ment of a small warehouse building, in the thirties between 
                   First Avenue and the East River, in New York.  It is a 
                   long and narrow machine shop, full of interest and character 
                   in its mechanical layout.  Miniatures of engine-models of 
                   various kinds -- vats of molten lead -- carbon racks -- 
                   welding instruments -- delicate light bulbs, and such other 
                   apparatus as composes a combination shop and laboratory of 
                   this machine type.  WE HOLD A MOMENT on Wynant in the midst 
                   of an experiment over the combustion engine. Then from the 
                   background a workman named Tom, also dressed in overalls, 
                   a man of about thirty-five, comes in from an adjoining 
                   shop.  He comes toward Wynant.
    
                                         TOM
                             (hesitant -- in a mild tone)
                             Your daughter's here, Mr. Wynant.
                                  (then, as Wynant 
                                  doesn't seem to 
                                  hear him, he speaks 
                                  louder)
                             Mr. Wynant!
    
                   Wynant, startled out of his absorption, drops a delicate 
                   piece of metal (or whatever fragile wiring or part he would 
                   be holding), and turns furiously on Tom.
    
                   Wynant Haven't you any more sense than to shout at me like 
                   that!
    
                                         TOM
                             I'm sorry...  but...
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (picking up the 
                                  little piece -- 
                                  its edges are 
                                  spoiled)
                             Two weeks work gone for nothing.
    
                                         TOM
                             I just wanted to tell you...
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (interrupting)
                             I don't care what you wanted to 
                             tell me.  You're through!  Get 
                             your things and get out!
    
                   The workman shrugs his shoulders and starts away.  WE PAN 
                   Wynant to a bench on which there are several acetylene 
                   torches.  He is examining the part as he goes, muttering 
                   and growling to himself.
    
                                         WYNANT
                             It's a good thing I'm going away -- 
                             no peace -- no quiet.  Everybody 
                             interrupting me --
    
                   PANNING SHOT -- DOOR TO SHOP.
    
                   DOROTHY WYNANT comes to the door and looks in.  Tom is 
                   seen taking off his overalls, preparatory to leaving.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             Can we come in?
    
                   Tom looks up as she speaks to him.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             Did you tell him?
    
                                         TOM
                             Sorry, Miss Wynant.  He didn't 
                             give me a chance.
    
                   Dorothy comes in, followed by ANDREW READE.  She is a young 
                   girl of about twenty-one, spirited and high-tempered like 
                   her father.  She has great natural beauty and distinction 
                   ...  the crisp product of a strict finishing school.  She 
                   is dressed in smart, simple street dress, with a fur coat 
                   over it.
    
                   Andrew Reade is a good-looking boy fresh from college.  He 
                   gives an impression of reliability and common sense.  CAMERA 
                   PANS WITH THEM as they go toward the workbench and Wynant.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             Dad!
    
                   Wynant straightens up, and as he looks and sees that it is 
                   his daughter, his whole expression changes.  He forgets 
                   his anger.  he is delighted to see her.
    
                                         WYNANT
                             Why didn't they tell me you were 
                             here?
    
                   Dorothy kisses him.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             I'm sorry to interrupt your work, 
                             but this is important.
    
                   Wynant looks over at Andrew standing behind Dorothy.  Andrew 
                   smiles at him.
    
                                         ANDREW
                             How are you?
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (to Dorothy - as he 
                                  turns off the 
                                  combustion engine)
                             Another young man.
    
                                         ANDREW
                             It's the same one.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (as if she were 
                                  speaking to a child 
                                  who didn't remember 
                                  his lessons)
                             It's been the same one for three 
                             months.
    
                                         WYNANT
                             Forgive me.
                                  (he shakes Andrew's 
                                  hand)
                             How are you?
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             Take a good look at him, Dad.
                                  (Wynant looks at 
                                  Andrew and smiles)
                             Now please try to remember him...  
                             'cause he's going to be your son-
                             in-law.
    
                   Wynant's look changes to one of serious interest.
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (surprised)
                             Well!
    
                                         ANDREW
                                  (to Wynant -- feeling 
                                  that Dorothy has 
                                  spoken too bluntly)
                             That is, if it's all right with 
                             you.
    
                                         WYNANT
                             And if it isn't?
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (to the front!)
                             He'll still be your son-in-law!
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (to Andrew, with 
                                  humor)
                             You see how much we have to say.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (puts her hand on 
                                  her father's arm)
                             Dad, this is what I really wanted 
                             to ask you....
    
                   Andrew, knowing that she wants to talk to her father alone, 
                   interrupts.
    
                                         ANDREW
                             Mind if I look around?
    
                                         WYNANT
                             Help yourself.
                                  (he turns and calls 
                                  off)
                             Oh, Tom, show this gentleman...
                                  (he stops as he 
                                  sees Tom is ready 
                                  to leave)
    
                   FULL SHOT -- INCLUDING TOM AT DOOR
    
                   Tom is dressed in his street suit, ready to go out.  Wynant 
                   stares at him in amazement.
    
                                         WYNANT
                             Where are you going?
    
                                         TOM
                                  (dryly)
                             Home!
    
                                         WYNANT
                             Home?
    
                                         TOM
                             I'm fired.
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (indignantly)
                             Who fired you?
    
                                         TOM
                             You did.
    
                   Dorothy laughs, Wynant shamefacedly joins her.
    
                                         WYNANT
                             Oh, forget it -- forget it.  Here 
                             ...  show this gentleman around...
    
                   Tom beams at Wynant and starts to take his coat and hat 
                   off as he speaks to Andrew.
    
                                         TOM
                             Right this way, sir.
    
                   Andrew follows him out.
    
                   CLOSE SHOT -- WYNANT AND DOROTHY
    
                   She pulls her father down beside her on a bench, or possibly 
                   she climbs up on the long work bench -- shoves the acetylene 
                   torches to a distance -- and with her arms around him affec- 
                   tionately, continues:
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             Mother's set her heart on a big 
                             church wedding.
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (parenthetically)
                             Yes, she would.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do 
                             it on one condition -- that you're 
                             there to give me away.
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (chuckling)
                             What would your mother say to that?
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (obstinately)
                             This is my wedding.
    
                                         WYNANT
                             Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing 
                             ...  all of us there ...  your 
                             other and me and your stepfather?
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (she evidently has 
                                  no love for her 
                                  stepfather)
                             He can stay home.  Please, Dad, 
                             won't you?
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (doubtful)
                             If you think it'll be all right.
    
                   Dorothy jumps down from the bench happily.  She kisses 
                   him, delighted to have won him over
    
                                         WYNANT
                             Wait a minute.  When is it going 
                             to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
    
                                         DOROTHY (SURPRISED)
                             Where are you going?
    
                                         WYNANT
                             It's a secret.  I can't even tell 
                             you, my dear.  I've got an important 
                             idea to work on.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             A new invention?
    
                                         WYNANT
                             Yes.
                                  (then significantly, 
                                  and with measured 
                                  tone)
                             And I don't want anybody to steal 
                             it from me.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (disappointed)
                             We were planning to be married 
                             right after Christmas.
    
                                         WYNANT
                             Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (brightening again)
                             It's a promise?
    
                                         WYNANT
                             That's one thing I won't forget.
                                  (he looks at his 
                                  watch)
                             Where's Macaulay?  I ought to be 
                             starting.
    
                   Dorothy takes his watch while he starts to take off his 
                   overalls.  There is an odd chain attached to the watch, 
                   with links of gold, copper, and silver.  As he slips off 
                   the overalls, he speaks to Dorothy without looking at her, 
                   trying to keep a casual note in his voice.  CAMERA IS 
                   PANNING DURING THE SCENE.
    
                                         WYNANT
                             How's your brother?
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (she looks at her 
                                  father 
                                  affectionately, 
                                  sorry for him)
                             He's all right.
    
                   WE EITHER PAN NOW ON WYNANT, OR GO TO A FULL SHOT -- as he 
                   goes to a washstand to clean up a bit.  The basin is on 
                   the side of the room.  The washstand could, if desired, be 
                   in a small closet, and the following dialogue is played 
                   back and forth during this business.
    
                                         WYNANT
                             I'd like to see him.  Why don't 
                             you bring him down?
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (dangling the watch 
                                  chain)
                             You know how it is, Dad.  He's 
                             sort of under Mother's thumb.
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (brushing his hair 
                                  a bit)
                             I know -- I know --
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (still monkeying 
                                  with the watch -- 
                                  winding it)
                             You're not missing much.  He's 
                             cuckoo.
    
                   Wynant comes back from the washstand -- CAMERA MOVING UP 
                   FOR A CLOSEUP ON THE TWO.
    
                                         WYNANT
                             Like all the rest of us.
                                  (he leans closer to 
                                  Dorothy, speaking 
                                  humorously)
                             Has this fellow...
                                  (he indicates Andrew 
                                  with a nod of his 
                                  head)
                             ...has he seen the whole family?
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (nodding and smiling)
                             And he still wants to marry me!
    
                                         WYNANT
                             He's a brave man.
    
                   They look off as Andrew enters the shop again.
    
                   MEDIUM SHOT --
    
                   Andrew comes over to them with added interest and 
                   admiration.
    
                                         ANDREW 
                                         (TO WYNANT)
                             I didn't know you invented that 
                             Smelting Process.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (she holds the watch 
                                  and chain toward 
                                  Andrew)
                             Look -- those are the first metals 
                             that came through.
                                  (she indicates the 
                                  links in the chain)
    
                   Andrew looks interestedly at them as she dangles the chain 
                   before him.  Wynant is feeling his shin bone.  He gives a 
                   little grunt of pain.  Dorothy turns sympathetically to 
                   him.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             Poor Dad, does that still bother 
                             you?
    
                                         WYNANT
                             Only in bad weather.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             But it isn't bad weather now.
    
                                         WYNANT
                             Better get home before it is.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (kissing Wynant)
                             Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare 
                             forget...  December 30th.
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (to Andrew, with a 
                                  warm friendliness)
                             Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of 
                             Dorothy.  Show her that there is 
                             such a thing as a happy marriage.
    
                                         ANDREW
                                  (sincerely)
                             I'll do my best.
    
                   Dorothy and Andrew start out, saying last goodbye's to 
                   Wynant and Tom.  WE TRUCK ON THEM
    
                   AS THEY GO OUT TO:
    
                   STAIRWAY FROM BASEMENT TO FIRST FLOOR - TRUCKING.
    
                                         ANDREW
                             All settled?
                                  (Dorothy nods)
                             Grand!
                                  (then, after a second)
                             Why did your mother ever divorce 
                             him?  He's swell.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             Wel-l-l, it seems he has a 
                             secretary.
    
                                         ANDREW
                                  ((understanding)
                             Oh.
                                  (he turns to Dorothy, 
                                  smiling)
                             I'll do my own typing!
    
                   They have reached the top of the stairs now and are in a 
                   long and narrow corridor, a service elevator at one end, 
                   and a door leading to the street at the other.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (looking to street 
                                  ...  it is snowing)
                             Dad's a good barometer...
                                  (she sees a taxi 
                                  draw up in front 
                                  of the building)
                             Quick! -- Here's a cab.
    
                   They exit to street.
    
                   EXTERIOR STREET -- LATE AFTERNOON -- BLIZZARD
    
                   It is a shabby, dreary street with warehouse and a deserted 
                   brewery.  There is a driving snow-storm.  Dorothy and Andrew 
                   come out as the cab is pulling up at the curb, and with 
                   difficulty against the wind and driving sleet, they go 
                   forward ready to take it.  The cab door opens and an 
                   umbrella comes out and is opened, almost in their faces.  
                   The umbrella completely covers the upper part of the man 
                   who is carrying it.  He turns to pay the driver.  Dorothy 
                   recognizes Macaulay and pulls up the umbrella to speak to 
                   him under it.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             Hello, there, Mr. Macaulay.
    
                   CLOSEUP AT CURB -- THE GROUP
    
                   Macaulay raises the umbrella, surprised.  He is a fussy 
                   little bald-headed man of about forty, wearing glasses.  
                   He recognizes Dorothy and beams.
    
                                         MACAULAY
                             How are you?
                                  (then as the snow 
                                  pelts down, he 
                                  starts to hold his 
                                  umbrella over her)
                             Here.  Get under this.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
    
                   Dorothy climbs into the cab.  Andy follows her.  She 
                   snuggles close against him, cold.
    
                   Macaulay hands the driver a bill.
    
                                         MACAULAY
                                  (to Dorothy)
                             Is your father still in there?
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             He's waiting for you.
    
                                         MACAULAY
                             Did he tell you where he was going?
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             He wouldn't say.
    
                                         MACAULAY
                             Tch-tch-tch --
                                  (shutting the cab 
                                  door)
                             Well, goodbye, Miss Wynant.
                                  (then speaking to 
                                  the driver as the 
                                  driver is giving 
                                  him his change)
                             You wouldn't drive slowly, so you 
                             don't get a tip.
    
                                         DRIVER
                                  (grinning)
                             That's okay -- I took it!
    
                   He grins again and swings off, leaving Macaulay looking 
                   down at the change in his hand, indignant.  THEN WE PAN 
                   WITH HIM as he enters the building.
    
                   CORRIDOR FROM BASEMENT -- FULL SHOT.
    
                   Wynant comes up the stairway and starts for the service 
                   elevator as Macaulay comes in from outside.  Wynant is now 
                   in a business suit, but has no hat or overcoat on.  He 
                   doesn't see Macaulay.  He pulls open the door of the service 
                   elevator.  Macaulay starts to run toward Wynant with little 
                   fast steps, his bulky umbrella hanging from his arm.
    
                                         MACAULAY
                             Mr. Wynant...  Mr. Wynant!
    
                   Wynant turns, his hand holding open the elevator door.
    
                                         WYNANT
                             Hello, there! Come on up with me.
    
                   Macaulay follows Wynant into the elevator, panting a little.
    
                   SERVICE ELEVATOR -- WYNANT AND MACAULAY.
    
                   Wynant pushes the button and the elevator starts slowly 
                   up.  The elevator shaft is visible through the wooden bars 
                   of the elevator.  Wynant stands looking down at Macaulay, 
                   amused and friendly.
    
                                         WYNANT
                             Did you get my money?
    
                                         MACAULAY
                                  (he pulls a wallet 
                                  out of his pocket 
                                  and takes out a 
                                  sheaf of new bills.  
                                  He talks plaintively 
                                  as he does so)
                             I do wish you'd tell me where you're 
                             going.
    
                                         WYNANT
                             I'm not telling anyone.
    
                                         MACAULAY
                                  (protesting)
                             But suppose some business comes 
                             up...
    
                                         WYNANT
                             That's just why I'm going.
    
                   Macaulay starts to count out the bills into Wynant's hand.
    
                                         MACAULAY
                             One hundred...  two hundred...  
                             three...
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (takes the sheaf of 
                                  bills, impatient)
                             Never mind.
    
                                         MACAULAY
                             I wish you'd count them.  There's 
                             a thousand dollars there.
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (stuffing them 
                                  carelessly in his 
                                  pocket)
                             I trust you.
    
                                         MACAULAY
                             Isn't there anything else I can do 
                             for you? Have you bought your 
                             ticket?
    
                                         WYNANT
                             No.
    
                                         MACAULAY
                                  (there is a good-
                                  humored gleam in 
                                  his eye.  He sees 
                                  a chance of finding 
                                  out where Wynant 
                                  is going)
                             Well, let me do that for you.
    
                                         WYNANT
                             You might do that.  Get me a ticket 
                             for...
                                  (he stops suddenly 
                                  as he looks at 
                                  Macaulay and sees 
                                  the eager look in 
                                  his eye -- realizes 
                                  that he is about 
                                  to give himself 
                                  away)
                             No, you don't!
    
                   They smile at each other.  The elevator has reached the 
                   third floor by this time.  It stops.  Wynant gets out.
    
                   THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR -- CLOSE AT ELEVATOR.
    
                   Macaulay prepares to follow Wynant, but Wynant closes the 
                   door of the elevator, leaving him in it.
    
                                         WYNANT
                             Thanks, and goodbye.
    
                                         MACAULAY
                             What'll I do if something comes 
                             up?
    
                                         WYNANT
                             Settle it yourself.  What have I 
                             got a lawyer for?
    
                                         MACAULAY
                             Is Julia going with you?
    
                                         WYNANT
                             No.
    
                   Wynant reaches through the bar of the elevator door and 
                   pushes the button inside.  The elevator starts going down 
                   during the following dialogue. Macaulay stands inside, 
                   bewildered and worried.
    
                                         MACAULAY
                             But what if you need more money?
    
                                         WYNANT
                             I left instructions with Julia.  
                             She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
    
                   Wynant strides out of the scene.  The elevator is beginning 
                   to disappear, carrying Macaulay.
    
                                         MACAULAY
                                  (with his face 
                                  upturned, he goes 
                                  on pleading until 
                                  he disappears out 
                                  of  sight -- he is 
                                  calling up)
                             You don't tell me a thing.  I don't 
                             know where you're going.  I don't 
                             know when you're coming back.  I 
                             don't know how to reach you if any 
                             business turns up...!
    
                   And the elevator goes down out of sight, his voice trailing 
                   as it does so.
    
                   WYNANT'S OFFICE -- TRUCKING AND PANNING ON WYNANT --
    
                   As we pick him up leaning down in front of a small safe, 
                   opening it.  He is talking to his bookkeeper, Tanner, as 
                   he does so.  Tanner is a little man with a quick eye and 
                   an eager manner.  He has his hat and coat on preparatory 
                   to leaving for the day.  He is closing and locking some 
                   cabinets as the scene ensues.
    
                   (Wynant's office is of a solid rather old-fashioned type 
                   such as would be found in a building of this kind.  It 
                   should, in fact, have windows through which a display room 
                   given to machinery can be seen)
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (as he opens the 
                                  safe)
                             My daughter's going to be married, 
                             Tanner.  Nice young man.  She just 
                             brought him.
    
                   Tanner listens preoccupied.  He seems a little nervous 
                   about Wynant looking in the safe.
    
                                         TANNER
                             Well, congratulations.
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (talking right on)
                             I'm going to give her a wedding 
                             present.  Thought I'd better do it 
                             now, before I forget it.  I can 
                             drop them on my way to...
                                  (by this time Wynant 
                                  has pulled out a 
                                  box and is puzzled 
                                  to see it empty)
                             That's funny....
                                  (he leans down and 
                                  hunts through the 
                                  different papers 
                                  in the safe.  He 
                                  doesn't find what 
                                  he wants.  He turns 
                                  to Tanner)
                             Where are those bonds?
    
                                         TANNER
                             Bonds, sir?
    
                                         WYNANT
                             I know I left them there.

                             Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (still worried --

                             Maybe she has.

                                  (he goes out)
    
                   As soon as Wynant goes out, Tanner looks after him.  He 
                   seems worried.  He looks apprehensively back toward the 
                   safe.
    
                                                                DISSOLVE TO:
    
                   A RADIO IN A NEW YORK APARTMENT -- CLOSEUP.
    
                   This is Julia Wolf's apartment, a fashionable penthouse 
                   furnished in very new modernistic style, but we do not 
                   reveal it as we dissolve in.  We are merely HOLDING ON THE 
                   RADIO AND A MAN -- JOE MORELLI -- who sits in front of it, 
                   in his shirt sleeves. Morelli is a tough looking gangster.  
                   He has the radio on.  He is looking at a copy of Vogue.  A 
                   woman's voice comes over the scene from off stage.
    
                                         JULIA'S VOICE
                             How do you want it?
    
                                         MORELLI
                             Straight.
                                  (turning a page of 
                                  Vogue -- holding 
                                  it up to the light.  
                                  Through the 
                                  transparent page, 
                                  the corsets show 
                                  through under the 
                                  evening gowns)
                             Do women really wear them things?
    
                   Suddenly there is the sound of a key in the door.  Morelli 
                   looks up quickly, his hand going To what we know is his 
                   gun, in his hip pocket --
    
                   AS CAMERA PULLS BACK RAPIDLY TO REVEAL:
    
                   FULL SHOT OF THE APARTMENT -- A PENTHOUSE -- PROCESS 
                   GLASS.
    
                   WE HOLD FOR A MOMENT as Morelli rises noiselessly and stands 
                   there, alert and ready for anyone.  NOW CAMERA SWINGS 
                   RAPIDLY OVER TO THE:
    
                   DOOR -- CLOSE SHOT ON WYNANT.
    
                   As he enters, having used his own key.  He still seems 
                   occupied, and doesn't see Morelli as he comes through.  
                   CAMERA SWINGS RAPIDLY BACK TO:
    
                   CLOSEUP ON MORELLI -- BEFORE THE RADIO.
    
                   He stands there, quietly menacing, his hand on his hip.
    
                                         MORELLI
                             You're in the wrong place, mister.
    
                                                                    BACK TO:
    
                   FLASH WYNANT -- CLOSEUP.
    
                   Wynant looks off at him, surprised and angry.
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (sarcastically)
                             Am I?
    
                                                                    BACK TO:
    
                   FLASH MORELLI -- CLOSEUP.
    
                   AS WE PAN HIM FORWARD a few steps.  He gives Wynant a savage 
                   double-O.
    
                                         MORELLI
                             What's on your mind? What do you 
                             want?
    
                                         JULIA'S VOICE (O.S.)
                             Who is it, Joe?
    
                                         MORELLI
                                  (watching Wynant)
                             That's what I want to know.
    
                   MEDIUM SHOT -- THE APARTMENT.
    
                   As Julia comes into the room, with two drinks in her hand.  
                   She is a woman of about thirty.
    
                   She is in very elaborate lounging pajamas, her hair is too 
                   well waved, her nails too red, her eyebrows too delicately 
                   arched.  But she has the look of a hard businesswoman 
                   underneath it all.  She looks disturbed as she sees it is 
                   Wynant.
    
                                         JULIA
                             We're just having a little drink.
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (dryly)
                             So I see.
    
                   Morelli looks from one to the other.  In Wynant's attitude 
                   of displeased proprietorship, he gets his hint of who he 
                   is.  he reaches for his coat over the chair and starts to 
                   put it on.
    
                                         JULIA
                                  (her eyes still on 
                                  Wynant)
                             See you later, Joe.
    
                   Morelli looks from one to the other, and then slowly gets 
                   his hat and starts out.
    
                                         MORELLI
                             Sorry.  I didn't know I was talking 
                             to the boy friend.  S'long.
    
                   He walks carelessly and arrogantly out of the door, slamming 
                   it after him.
    
                   CAMERA MOVES IN FOR A CLOSE SHOT OF JULIA AND WYNANT.  She 
                   puts the drinks down.  She tries to ignore Wynant's very 
                   evident displeasure.
    
                                         WYNANT
                             Who's that man?
    
                                         JULIA
                             He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I 
                             used to know.
    
                                         WYNANT
                             I thought you'd given up that sort 
                             of friend.
    
                                         JULIA
                             This is the first time I've seen 
                             him in years.  I didn't want him 
                             to think I was high-hatting him.
    
                                         WYNANT
                             I don't like him.
    
                                         JULIA
                                  (moving over to 
                                  him, trying to 
                                  conciliate him)
                             Don't worry.  You won't see him 
                             again.
                                  (she tries to take 
                                  Wynant's coat and 
                                  hat)
                             What happened? Did you change your 
                             mind about going?
    
                                         WYNANT
                             No.  I just came back for a second.  
                             I wanted to get those bonds.
    
                                         JULIA
                                  (she controls her 
                                  fear under an air 
                                  of ignorance)
                             What bonds?
    
                                         WYNANT
                             The government bonds.  The ones 
                             you took from the office safe.
    
                                         JULIA
                                  (smoothly lying)
                             Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell 
                             them a long time ago.
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (in a level tone)
                             I'd never tell you to sell those.  
                             I bought them for my daughter.
    
                                         JULIA
                             Don't you remember....
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (interrupting her)
                             Now see here, Julia.  You're 
                             counting a little too much on my 
                             being absent-minded.  You've been 
                             taking a little here and there for 
                             some time, and I haven't said 
                             anything about it.  But this is 
                             fifty thousand dollars!
    
                                         JULIA
                                  (flying into a temper 
                                  to try to hide her 
                                  guilt)
                             Do you realize that you're accusing 
                             me of ....
    
                                         WYNANT
                             No one else had the combination of 
                             that safe.  You took them.  What 
                             did you do with them?
    
                                         JULIA
                                  (in a fury)
                             What if I did take them? I'm sick 
                             and tired of seeing you hand out 
                             thousands of dollars to that family 
                             of yours....
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (cutting in)
                             That's my business.
    
                                         JULIA

                                  listening to him)
                             supporting that gang of loafers! 
                             There's not one of them that cares 
                             a damn for you.  A wife who threw 
                             you out the first time your foot 
                             slipped.  They wouldn't raise a 
                             hand to help you.  And I've given 
                             my whole life for you.  If you 
                             kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? 
                             Out in the gutter!
                                  (then defiantly)
                             Sure I took those bonds.  Who has 
                             a better right -- ?
    
                   WE HOLD A MOMENT.   There is a slight pause, then Wynant 
                   quietly, and unheeding all that she has said, starts for 
                   the phone.  WE PAN HIM OVER AND HOLD as he picks up the 
                   phone (but not the receiver as yet) and speaks off to Julia:
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (quietly)
                             I want that money right now, or 
                             I'll hand you over to the police.
    
                                         JULIA (O.S.)
                                  (not believing that 
                                  he will do it)
                             Go ahead!
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (lifts phone from 
                                  receiver now -- 
                                  still quietly)
                             They'll be pretty rough with 
                             you....with your record.
    
                   CAMERA PULLS BACK, and Julia hurries into the scene.
    
                                         JULIA
                                  (contemptuous)
                             That's a fine thing to throw up to 
                             me after all I've been to you....
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (in phone)
                             Hello ....  give me ....
                                  (Julia grabs the 
                                  telephone from 
                                  him, in a fury.  
                                  She puts it down.  
                                  Puts the receiver 
                                  in place.  They 
                                  stand facing each 
                                  other)
                             Well ....  ?
    
                                         JULIA
                                  (in a surly tone)
                             I'll give it back to you ....  all 
                             I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (he takes her by 
                                  the wrists, gripping 
                                  her hard, trying 
                                  to force the truth 
                                  from her)
                             You're going to return every cent 
                             of it!
    
                                         JULIA
                                  (flashing again)
                             I can't! I haven't got it!
    
                                         WYNANT
                                  (quickly)
                             What did you do with the rest?
    
                                         JULIA
                             I never had it.
    
                   THE TELEPHONE RINGS.
    
                                         WYNANT
                             Then someone was in with you.  Who 
                             was it? -- Who was it?
                                  (Julia makes a move 
                                  to answer the phone 
                                  which rings again 
                                  insistently)
                             I'll answer that --
                                  (he picks up the 
                                  phone)
                             Hello ...  hello ...
    
                                                                     CUT TO:
    
                   TELEPHONE BOOTH -- PUBLIC PAY STATION.
    
                   A weasel-faced little man, Nunheim, is in the booth at the 
                   phone, but as he hears WYNANT'S VOICE say "hello", he very 
                   quietly pulls down the hook for the receiver and places 
                   the receiver gently on it.  He turns away.
    
                                                                CUT BACK TO:
    
                   JULIA'S APARTMENT -- CLOSE SHOT AT PHONE AGAIN.
    
                   Wynant is clicking the receiver up and down, as he repeats 
                   several times, sharply:
    
                                         WYNANT
                             Hello ...  hello ...  hello ...  
                             HELLO ....
    
                   Then, evidently hearing the sound of the receiver being 
                   replaced, he impatiently puts the telephone down and turns 
                   back to Julia.
    
                                         WYNANT
                             You don't need to tell me.  I have 
                             a pretty good idea.
    
                   And with this WE PAN HIM as he puts on his hat and starts 
                   to walk out of the apartment -- with determination and a 
                   menacing purpose in his face.
    
                                         JULIA (O.S.)
                             What are you going to do?
    
                   Wynant turns at the door and smiles - a terrifying smile - 
                   and walks out.  The CAMERA SWINGS QUICKLY BACK TO JULIA.  
                   She looks after him terrified as we
    
                                                         CUT OR DISSOLVE TO:
    
                   A STREET AT NIGHT -- LIGHTING EFFECT.
    
                   Wynant strides down the street, his long, lean, narrow 
                   form casting a long shadow on the snowy pavement.  THE 
                   CAMERA HOLDS IN A RUNNING SHOT ON THE SHADOW as it elongates 
                   still further, and finally disappears.
    
                                                                   FADE OUT:
    
                   (NOTE: We should get the above shadow effect through heavy 
                   snow, (via reflection of street lamps).  The idea and mood 
                   here of the shadow of the "thin man" as it strides rapidly 
                   through the night is purposely intended for a necessary 
                   effect.)
    
                   FADE IN:
    
                   CLOSEUP OF A CHRISTMAS WREATH.
    
                   The wreath is enormous, and under the conventional greeting: 
                   "A MERRY CHRISTMAS", which is in silver across it, there 
                   is a current unconventional greeting also in silver, which 
                   reads:
    
                                     (This slogan to come)
    
                   On sound track behind the shot an orchestra is playing 
                   gaily.  Possibly an arrangement that Lombardo would make 
                   on "JINGLE BELLS, JINGLE BELLS".  There is also the sound 
                   of gay chatter and jingles of many cocktail shakers.  NOW 
                   CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL THE BAR OF A SPEAKEASY, or, to 
                   be more up to date, the bar of a Biltmore or a Waldorf 
                   Astoria Hotel.  It was against the glass of the bar that 
                   the Christmas wreath was first shown.  It is about three 
                   o'clock in the afternoon.  Almost all of the people sitting 
                   on the high stools in front of the bar are women.  Several 
                   bartenders are shaking cocktails.  The music, which, by 
                   the way, comes from an adjoining tea dansant room, 
                   continues.  There is a holiday air about the whole place.  
                   A sophistication and a gaiety belonging to thirsty New 
                   York of the present moment.  CAMERA RUNS DOWN THE LINE OF 
                   THE BAR AND HOLDS AT THE END, where a bartender is placing 
                   two cocktails on a tray held by a waiter.  WE TRUCK ON THE 
                   WAITER as he takes the tray into the adjoining room.  The 
                   room is quite filled with the afternoon tango crowd, and 
                   several couples are dancing on the floor.  WE HOLD as the 
                   waiter stops at a small table along the wall.  Dorothy and 
                   Andrew are seated there.  Dorothy is looking very glum.
    
                                         ANDREW
                                  (putting his hand 
                                  on hers)
                             Cheer up, darling.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             I'm sorry.
    
                   Dorothy tries to smile, but it's a dreary attempt.  The 
                   waiter puts down the cocktails and leaves.
    
                                         ANDREW
                                  (holds up his glass)
                             Here's to us!
    
                   He drinks his cocktail.  Dorothy takes a sip of hers.  
                   Andrew goes on talking, trying to get her out of the 
                   doldrums.
    
                                         ANDREW
                             By this time next year, we'll be 
                             two old married people ...  trimming 
                             the tree ...  hanging up the 
                             stockings for the children ...
                                  (then as she looks 
                                  up)
                             ...  well, the child, then.
    
                   Dorothy tries to smile, but she is worried, and cannot 
                   enter into his fun.  She puts her drink down.
    
                                         ANDREW
                             What's the matter, darling ...  
                             not sweet enough?
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (listlessly)
                             It's all right.
    
                   (NOTE TO VAN: If you want them to get up and join the 
                   dancers, it can be done at this point.  After Dorothy says, 
                   "It's all right", Andrew says, "Come on, let's dance.  
                   I've got to get you out of the dumps somehow" -- and pulls 
                   her to her feet.  The following scene continues now, as 
                   follows, in a PANNING SHOT OF THEM DANCING.)
    
                                         ANDREW
                                  (leaning forward -- 
                                  serious now)
                             Darling, your father's all right.  
                             He'll turn up in time.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (turns to him -- 
                                  suddenly distraught)
                             But tonight is Christmas Eve!
    
                                         ANDREW
                             He's just forgotten.  You know he 
                             forgets everything.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             He's never forgotten a promise to 
                             me.  I'm worried about him.  I 
                             know something's happened to him.
    
                   She looks off scene toward the bar.  Suddenly her attention 
                   is riveted on someone.
    
                                         ANDREW
                             What could happen to him, darling?  
                             You mustn't worry....
                                  (then as he half 
                                  rises, he continues)
                             What is it?
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             Just a minute...
    
                   She leaves the table -- her eyes still fixed eagerly on 
                   the man she has seen.  WE TRUCK AND PAN WITH HER as she 
                   goes forward to the bar.  And as she comes in, we see her 
                   react eagerly as she confronts a good-looking man of about 
                   thirty-five, tall, casual, and worldly wise, who is standing 
                   in front of the bar, his face reflected in the mirror.  
                   This is NICK CHARLES.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (to the bartender)
                             Another Martini --
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             Hello, there!
    
                   CLOSEUP AT THE BAR -- NICK AND DOROTHY
    
                   Nick Charles turns to her.  He smiles at her.
    
                   He hasn't the faintest idea who she is, but he's not going 
                   to discourage such a pretty girl.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (very cordially)
                             Hello!
                                  (then over his 
                                  shoulder to the 
                                  bartender)
                             Make it two!
                                  (then back to Dorothy)
                             How are you?
    
                   Dorothy realizes that he hasn't any remembrance of her.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             You know, we know each other.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (heartily)
                             Of course we do! We've been friends 
                             for years.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (inspecting him)
                             Aren't you Nick Charles?
    
                                         NICK
                                  (his face changes.  
                                  He realizes that 
                                  she does know him)
                             Yes.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             You don't remember me.....  I'm 
                             Dorothy Wynant.
    
                   The bartender sets the drinks on the bar before Nick, who 
                   looks at Dorothy puzzled, trying to realize that this is 
                   the child he used to know.
    
                                         NICK
                             Not that scrawny little....?
                                  (he puts out his 
                                  hand as if measuring 
                                  a little girl's 
                                  height)
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (smiling)
                             Yes.
    
                                         NICK
                             How did you ever remember me?
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (intently)
                             was fascinated with you....  a 
                             real live detective....  You used 
                             to tell me the most wonderful 
                             stories.  Were they true?
    
                                         NICK
                             Probably not.
    
                   Andrew comes up to them.  Dorothy turns to introduce him.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He 
                             worked on a case for father.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (shaking hands with 
                                  Andrew)
                             Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill 
                             him.
                                  (then to Dorothy)
                             How is your father?
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             That's what I was going to ask 
                             you.  he's disappeared!
    
                                         NICK
                             Disappeared!
    
                                         ANDREW
                                  (to Dorothy)
                             Now don't say that -- he's just 
                             off somewhere working.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (to Nick)
                             I can't find him.  I've tried 
                             everything.  I thought you might 
                             know.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (chuckling)
                             I don't know anything -- I've been 
                             in California for four years.  
                             What about his lawyer? Used to be 
                             a guy named Mac-- something.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             Macaulay.
    
                                         NICK
                             That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             tried him once -
    
                                         NICK
                             Why don't you try him again?
    
                                         ANDY
                                  (digging in his 
                                  pocket)
                             Here's a nickle.
    
                   Andrew gives her a nickle and she goes off.
    
                   Now that she has gone Andrew drops his pretense of 
                   minimizing her father's failure to appear.  he steps up 
                   close to Nick.
    
                                         ANDREW
                             She's got me worrying, too.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (easily, as he 
                                  reaches for his 
                                  cocktail NOTE: 
                                  During the entire 
                                  play, Nick is always 
                                  reaching for a 
                                  cocktail!)
                             Don't start worrying about him.  
                             He's a good guy, but screwy.
    
                                         ANDREW
                                  (impressed by what 
                                  he has just heard)
                             Why did that man want to kill him?
    
                                         NICK
                             Said he stole his invention.
    
                                         ANDREW
                             Do you suppose.....  ?
    
                   The bartender is placing more drinks in front of Nick.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (to Andrew)
                             What?
    
                                         ANDREW
                                  (deciding he is 
                                  silly to get so 
                                  worried)
                             Nothing.
    
                                         NICK
                             You better take a drink.
    
                   He hands him one of the cocktails.
    
                   As they start to drink, a commotion is heard offscene ...  
                   a dog barking ...  men's voices raised in protestation ... 
                   and a a woman's voice above it all.  It is NORA, Nick's 
                   wife.
    
                                         NORA'S VOICE (O.S.)
                             Asta! Where are you going? Asta!
    
                   Bartenders, as well as Nick and Andrew, look off toward 
                   the commotion.
    
                                                                     CUT TO:
    
                   ENTRANCE OF THE BAR -- FROM THE CLOAK ROOM OR CORRIDOR.
    
                   NORA CHARLES, Nick's wife, is coming through.  She is a 
                   woman of about twenty-six...  a tremendously vital person, 
                   interested in everybody and everything, in contrast to 
                   Nick's apparent indifference to anything except when he is 
                   going to get his next drink.  There is a warm understanding 
                   relationship between them.  They are really crazy about 
                   each other, but undemonstrative and humorous in their 
                   companionship.  They are tolerant, easy-going, taking drink 
                   for drink, and battling their way together with a dry humor.  
                   Just now Nora has been shopping.  Her arms are full of 
                   small packages.  Her hat is askew.  She is pulled along 
                   bodily by a small white Sealingham on a leash.  A doorman 
                   and a hat-check clerk are following her, protesting at her 
                   bringing the dog into this fashionable hotel.  The dog is 
                   exitedly barking.
    
                                         DOORMAN
                             Madame, you can't bring that dog 
                             in here!
    
                                         NORA
                             I'm not bringing him.  He's bringing 
                             me!
                                  (then to the dog)
                             Asta!  Asta!
    
                   But the dog pays no attention.  He pulls her like a streak 
                   out of the scene toward the bar.
    
                   Nora's packages are left in a trail behind her as she 
                   stumbles after him.  The attendants follow after her, 
                   picking up the parcels and protesting vehemently.
    
                                         ATTENDANTS
                             But Madame...  dogs aren't 
                             allowed.... It isn't only your 
                             dog...  but if we started....
                             Madame, you dropped your package....  
                             etc.
    
                   BAR -- CLOSE SHOT
    
                   As Asta, the dog, rushes in, still with Nora on the other 
                   end of the leash.  The dog makes a bee-line for Nick, pulls 
                   away and -- ker-plunk! -- he leaps clear up into Nick's 
                   arms.  He is barking with delight.  He seems to have a 
                   particular desire to lick Nick's nose.  Nora, more 
                   dishevelled than ever and breathless, enters, panting.  
                   She realizes that this was Asta's objective.
    
                                         NORA
                             So it's you he was after!
    
                                         NICK
                             Hello, baby.
    
                                         NORA
                                  (indicating the dog)
                             He's dragged me into every gin 
                             mill on the block.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (in explanation)
                             I had him out this morning.
    
                                         NORA
                             I thought so.  He even tried to 
                             drag me into the gentlemen's --
    
                                         NICK
                                  (stopping her to 
                                  introduce Andrew)
                             Oh, this is Andy --
    
                   Nora and Andy smile at each other.
    
                                         NORA
                             How're you, Andy?

                             I don't usually look this way, but 
                             I've been Christmas shopping.
    
                   One of the attendants who followed Nora comes up.  He hands 
                   Nora several of her packages.
    
                                         ATTENDANT
                             Madame, I'm afraid you'll have 
                             to....

                                  (interrupting)
                             It's all right, Joe.  It's my dog...
                                  (and as an 
                                  afterthought, waving 
                                  his hand at Nora)
                             ....and my wife.

                             You might have mentioned me first.

                                  (to Joe)
                             He's well-trained.  He'll behave 
                             himself.

                             As long as there isn't a fire 
                             hydrant.  What I've gone through --

                             He might bite someone.
    
                                         NICK
                             He's all right.
                                  (He puts Asta down 
                                  on the floor. He 
                                  speaks to the dog)
                             Now lie down.

                                  him, wagging his 
                                  tail, but making 
                                  no move to obey 
                                  him.  Nick speaks 
                                  with more authority)
                             Lie down!
                                  (still Asta looks 
                                  fondly up at him, 
                                  without obeying)
                             Well then, stand up!
                                  (then triumphantly 
                                  to Joe)
                             See?
    
                   The attendant laughs and moves off.
    
                   Dorothy comes toward them from the telephone booth.  She 
                   seems a little more cheerful.  Andrew watches her anxiously.
    
                                         ANDREW
                             Any luck?
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             He's just around the corner.
    
                                         NICK
                             Your father?
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to 
                             see him.
    
                   Nick realizes that Dorothy and his wife have not met.  He 
                   makes the introduction very casually, waving his hand to 
                   indicate Nora.
    
                                         NICK
                             Oh, my wife -- Dorothy Wynant.
    
                   The two women smile in acknowledgment.  Nora looks at 
                   Dorothy with warm interest.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             How do you do?  I'm sorry we have 
                             to rush.
    
                                         NICK
                             We're at the Normandie for a couple 
                             of weeks.  Why don't you drop 
                             around?
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             Thanks.  We will.  Goodbye.
    
                                         ANDREW
                             Goodbye.
    
                   The two go quickly off.  Nora looks after them.

                             tell you.  Dorothy is really my 
                             daughter.  You see, it was Spring 
                             in Venice, and I was so young.  I 
                             didn't know what I was doing.  We 
                             were all like that on my father's 
                             side.

                             side?
    
                                         NICK

                             You're not going to have anything 
                             on me.

                   Nick

                   CLOSEUP OF AN ICE BAG.
    
                   Nick's hands are screwing the cover on the ice bag.  CAMERA 
                   PULLS BACK TO reveal him in the bathroom of his suite at 
                   the Normandie.  He has just filled the bag from the wash 
                   basin which is full of ice.  THE CAMERA TRUCKS with him as 
                   he goes into the bedroom and over to the bed.
    
                   CLOSE UP OF ASTA.
    
                   He is sitting on the foot of the bed, his head cocked, 
                   looking anxiously at Nora at the other side of the bed.
    
                   CLOSE SHOT - AT BED.
    
                   Nora is lying on the bed, dressed as we saw her in the 
                   last scene, except for her hat.
    
                   Nick comes in and puts the ice bag on her head.  Nora opens 
                   her eyes and speaks feebly to Nick.
    
                                         NORA

                             That last Martini.
    
                   Asta, delighted that Nora is all right, rushes to her, and 
                   licks her face.

                             I can't lie here.  I've got to get 
                             up and trim that darned Christmas 
                             tree.

                             Take it easy.
    
                   The doorbell of the apartment rings.  Nick starts into the 
                   next room.  Nora looks off perturbed.  She doesn't feel up 
                   to visitors.

                   LIVING ROOM OF SUITE - (SKYLINE THROUGH WINDOWS)
    
                   In one corner of the living room is an enormous Christmas 
                   tree, without any ornaments on it.  The room is a mass of 
                   boxes and excelsior.  Nick comes from the bedroom and opens 
                   the outer room.  Macaulay stands outside, his eyes blinking 
                   behind their glasses, in friendly welcome.  CAMERA MOVES 
                   UP FOR CLOSE SHOT ON THE TWO.

                   WE PAN Nick over to a table where there are bottles of 
                   Scotch and ice and syphons of seltzer.

                                  (pressing syphon of 
                                  seltzer)
                             My wife's father died and left her 
                             a lumber mill and a narrow guage 
                             railroad and a couple of other 
                             things.  And I'm looking after 
                             them.
    
                                         MACAULAY
                             I see.  I see.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (coming over to him)
                             What's all the fuss about? Is he 
                             in hiding?
    
                                         MACAULAY
                             You know as much about it as I do.  
                             I haven't seen him in three months.
    
                                         NICK
                             No word at all?
    
                                         MACAULAY
                             He sends word through Julia Wolf 
                             when he wants money...  I give it 
                             to her and she gives it to him.
    
                   The telephone rings.  Nick goes over to it, speaking to 
                   Macaulay as he goes.
    
                                         NICK

                                  (he picks up the 
                                  phone)

                             Hello....  just a minute.
    
                   Nick, who has listened on the phone, holds it out toward 
                   Macaulay.
    
                                         NICK
                             It's for you.

                                  and starts for the 
                                  phone)
                             Your office.
    
                   Macaulay takes the telephone.  Nora appears in the doorway 
                   to the bedroom.  She has a box of Christmas tree ornaments 
                   in her hand.  The ice bag is tied on her head, slightly 
                   askew.
    
                   She is followed by Asta.
    
                                         NORA
                             Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the 
                             house?
                                  (she looks over and 
                                  sees Macaulay at 
                                  the phone)
                             Oh, it's you.

                             Yes?
    
                   Then he turns to Nora.  In his desire to be polite, he 
                   almost misses both the introduction to Nora, and his 
                   telephone call.
    
                                         NICK

                             How do you do?
                                  (he turns hastily 
                                  back to the 
                                  telephone. Nora 
                                  walks out of the 
                                  scene, toward the 
                                  Xmas tree)

                             Where is he?  Very well.
                                  (he hangs up and 
                                  turns to Nick)
                             He's back in town....
                                  (then as Nick looks 
                                  mystified, he adds:)
                             Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting 
                             for me now.
                                  (then realizing 
                                  that Nora doesn't 
                                  know what he is 
                                  talking about)

                             I've been so upset.  It's no joke 
                             working for a man like that.  I 
                             must be off.
                                  (he starts for the 
                                  door, which Nick 
                                  opens for him)
                             Goodbye....  Goodbye,

                             S'long.
    
                   Macaulay shuts the door after him only to open it again.
    
                                         MACAULAY

                             Merry Christmas!
    
                   He shuts the door again.
    
                   During the above, Nora has started to decorate the tree.  
                   She is standing on a chair, a couple of Xmas ornaments in 
                   her hand, reaching toward the top or the tree.

                             once more, I'll kill 'em.
    
                   Nick starts to the telephone directory.

                   MEDIUM SHOT - JORGENSEN APARTMENT.
    
                   Mimi Jorgensen, formerly Mrs. Clyde Wynant, is at the phone.  
                   She is a slightly faded, but still very pretty woman of 
                   about forty-one or two.  She is utterly feminine, with 
                   bright, little ways of talking and moving.  She distrusts 
                   all women, even her daughter Dorothy, and treats all men 
                   with a flirtatious condescension, as if they were children.  
                   The only thing she really has any emotion about is her 
                   present husband, who she adores.  She is terrified that he 
                   will leave her, knowing, although she won't admit it, that 
                   he married her for her money.
    
                   The living room of her expensive apartment reflects her 
                   personality.  It is a modernized Victorian, full or 
                   alabaster lamps, curved soft chairs and gleaming satin.
    
                   Mimi is answering the telephone.  Dorothy stands in the 
                   doorway, listening to her mother as she takes off her hat 
                   and coat.  She is dressed in the same clothes in which we 
                   saw her at the hotel.
    
                                         MIMI

                                  it is Nick Charles, 
                                  her voice takes on 
                                  a flirtatious note)
                             How are you?....  Oh, I'm Mrs. 
                             Jorgensen now....

                                  pretends that she 
                                  doesn't know she 
                                  is there)

                             I take the message?

                             Oh, here she is.
    
                   Reluctantly she gives the phone to Dorothy.
    
                   She stands close to Dorothy, trying to hear the 
                   conversation.
    
                                                                    BACK TO:

                                  (then she realizes 
                                  how selfish her 
                                  feeling is)
                             Well, at least I'm glad he's all 
                             right.  Thank you for calling.  
                             Goodbye.
    
                   She hangs up.  Mimi eagerly questions her,
    
                                         MIMI
                             What is it?
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             Nothing.
    
                   Gilbert comes into the room.  He is a boy of about seventeen 
                   or eighteen.  He wears spectacles.  He is slight in build.  
                   The two women don't notice him.
    
                                         MIMI
                             That isn't true.  It was about 
                             your father.  Where is he?
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
    
                                         MIMI
                             No.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             You just want money -- and you 
                             haven't any right to any more.  He 
                             made a big settlement on you.
    
                                         MIMI
                             That's gone long ago.  I've got to 
                             see him.  Where is he?
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             I won't have you hounding him any 
                             more for money.
    
                                         GILBERT
                                  (to his mother)
                             I'll tell you.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             (turning on him acccusingly)
                             You've been listening again on 
                             that extension.
    
                                         GILBERT
                                  (very simply)
                             Of course.  What's an extension 
                             for?
    
                                         MIMI
                                  (to Gilbert, who is 
                                  evidently her 
                                  favorite of the 
                                  two children)
                             What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! 
                             What did he say?
    
                                         GILBERT
                             He said that father's in town.  
                             He's been seeing Julia right along.
    
                                         MIMI (BITTERLY)
                             That woman!
    
                                         GILBERT
                             She could tell you where father 
                             is.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             Mother ....  you couldn't do that.  
                             You couldn't go to her.
    
                                         MIMI
                             I didn't say I would.  But we've 
                             got to have money.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             Did it ever occur to you that Chris 
                             might work?
    
                                         MIMI
                                  (looking fearfully 
                                  off scene)
                             Shush!
    
                   CAMERA SWINGS RAPIDLY OVER TO:
    
                   BACK OF A SOFA
    
                   BIG CLOSEUP
    
                   From the sofa a man rises with languid dignity.  It is 
                   Chris Jorgensen.  He is younger than Mimi.  A very handsome 
                   man, but one whom you could know at first sight that you 
                   could not trust.
    
                                         MIMI'S VOICE (O.S.)
                             Chris!
    
                   Chris Jorgensen pays no attention to Mimi.  He throws 
                   Dorothy a deadly glance and walks with hurt dignity out of 
                   the room, carrying the newspaper he has been reading.  
                   CAMERA PULLS BACK FOR THE GROUP AGAIN:
    
                   DOROTHY, MIMI AND GILBERT
    
                   Mimi looks after Jorgensen, fearfully.  She turns to 
                   Dorothy.
    
                                         MIMI
                                  (sharply)
                             You've hurt his feelings!
    
                   She hurries out of the room after Jorgensen.  Dorothy looks 
                   after them, disgusted.  Gilbert watches Dorothy with 
                   detached, scientific interest.
    
                                         GILBERT
                             You know, you have an Oedipus 
                             complex and you won't admit it.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (this is the last 
                                  straw)
                             Oh, please, Gilbert!
    
                   She starts out of the room but Gilbert continues to talk 
                   to her, although she is not paying any attention.
    
                                         GILBERT
                             The trouble with you is that you 
                             won't face facts.  I know I have a 
                             mother fixation...  but it's 
                             slight......  it hasn't yet reached 
                             the point of...
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             Oh stop it!  Stop it!
    
                   Dorothy walks out.  Gilbert looks after her, bewildered by 
                   her lack or scientific interest.
    
                   JORGENSEN'S BEDROOM - MEDIUM
    
                   Jorgensen is standing in front of the mirror, adjusting 
                   his tie.  Mimi comes in, very much perturbed.  She goes to 
                   him affectionately.
    
                   Jorgensen realizes his power over her and uses it.
    
                                         MIMI
                             Don't mind what she says, Chris.
    
                                         JORGENSEN
                             How can I help but mind? I'm 
                             constantly humiliated...  just 
                             because I haven't money.
    
                                         MIMI
                                  (eagerly)
                             I'll get some.
    
                                         JORGENSEN
                             You've said that for weeks.
    
                                         MIMI
                             I know.
    
                                         JORGENSEN
                             Why don't you go to see Julia?  
                             She handles his money.
    
                                         MIMI
                                  (protesting)
                             Chris!
    
                                         JORGENSEN
                             All right.  All right.
    
                                         MIMI
                             I couldn't go near that woman.
    
                                         JORGENSEN
                             I said all right!
    
                   He picks up his hat and coat from a chair.
    
                   Mimi watches him anxiously.
    
                                         MIMI
                             What are you going to do?
    
                                         JORGENSEN
                                  (easily)
                             Just what I said I'd do.
    
                                         MIMI
                                  (in a panic, she 
                                  pleads)
                             You wouldn't do that...  you 
                             wouldn't!
    
                                         JORGENSEN
                                  (coldly - quietly)
                             Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
    
                                         MIMI (ALMOST CRYING)
                             Chris -- Chris -- !
    
                   But Jorgensen walks out.
    
                   OUTSIDE JORGENSEN'S DOOR - HALL.
    
                   Jorgensen strides out of the door and down the hall.  Mimi 
                   comes to the door.
    
                                         MIMI
                             Chris!
    
                   But Chris pays no attention.  Mimi, distraught, goes back 
                   into his room.  As she closes the door, we see Gilbert 
                   come out from behind the open door, where he has been 
                   listening.
    
                   JORGENSEN'S ROOM AGAIN.
    
                   Mimi stands irresolute for a minute, then goes to the 
                   telephone and dials a number.
    
                                         MIMI
                                  (on telephone)
                             Miss Wolfe?  Well this is Mrs. 
                             Jorgensen...  I wonder if I may 
                             see you?
    
                                                                     CUT TO:
    
                   JULIA'S APARTMENT - CLOSEUP AT PHONE
    
                   Julia is evidently very much startled by Mrs.  Jorgensen's 
                   calling her.
    
                                         JULIA
                                  (hesitatingly)
                             Why yes ....  yes.....
    
                   She puts down the telephone, thinking hard, worried by the 
                   idea or Mrs. Jorgensen's impending visit.  Suddenly she 
                   makes up her mind and hastily dials a number.
    
                                                                    BACK TO:
    
                   MIMI'S LIVING ROOM
    
                   Mimi gets up from the telephone.  There is a look of grim 
                   determination on her face.
    
                                                                DISSOLVE TO:
    
                   DESK OF JULIA WOLFE'S APARTMENT HOUSE.
    
                   There is a clerk, standing behind the desk, and a telephone 
                   operator at a small switchboard.
    
                   Mimi is standing in front of the desk.
    
                                         MIMI
                             What is Miss Wolfe's apartment 
                             number?
    
                                         CLERK
                             Nine A.
    
                   Mimi turns and walks across the lobby.  The CAMERA TRUCKS 
                   with her.  As she goes toward the elevator, Albert Nunheim 
                   is seen coming down the last steps of the stairs, out of 
                   her sight.  He is a weasel-faced, little man with a long 
                   nose, weak mouth, and a shifty look in his eye.  The clerk's 
                   voice comes over the SOUND TRACK calling after Mimi.
    
                                         CLERK'S VOICE (O.S.)
                             Who shall I say?
    
                   CLOSEUP OF NUNHEIM ON STAIRS.
    
                                         MIMI'S VOICE (O.S.)
                                  (shortly)
                             Miss Wolf expects me.
    
                   As Mimi says "Miss Wolfe", Nunheim stiffens and pulls back 
                   against the wall.  He waits there until he hears the sound 
                   of the elevator door closing.
    
                   He is evidently terrified by something that he has seen.  
                   He waits to be sure that Mimi has gone up in the elevator 
                   and then, with a furtive glance at the desk, CAMERA PULLS 
                   BACK AND PANS WITH HIM as he sneaks out and down the stairs 
                   on the other side of the elevator shaft leading down to 
                   the basement.
    
                   NINTH FLOOR OF THE APARTMENT HOUSE - TRUCKING SHOT
    
                   Mimi gets out of the elevator and goes to the door of the 
                   apartment 9-A across the hall.  She rings the doorbell.  
                   There is no response.  She rings again, a lock or grim 
                   determination on her face.
    
                   EXT.  OF BASEMENT ENTRANCE OF APT.  HOUSE
    
                   Nunheim comes out of the entrance, looks furtively up and 
                   down the street.  He takes out a cigarette, lights it, and 
                   then, with a pretense of being casual, walks off down the 
                   street.
    
                                                                    BACK TO:
    
                   EXT.  OF DOOR OF APT.  9-A
    
                   Getting no response to her ringing, Mimi is knocking on 
                   the door.  She is furious with Julia for not letting her 
                   in.  Still getting no answer, she tries the door.  She is 
                   surprised to find it is open.  She looks up and down the 
                   hall and then decides to investigate.  She walks in.
    
                   LIVING ROOM OF JULIA'S APT.  -
    
                   TRUCKING AND PANNING;
    
                   Mimi comes into the room.  She shuts the door slowly behind 
                   her.  She looks curiously around the room, interested to 
                   see what kind of a place her ex-husband has furnished for 
                   Julia.
    
                   Seeing no one in the room, she goes through it toward the 
                   bedroom.  As she gets to the door and looks curiously in, 
                   she stiffens and screams.
    
                   JULIA'S BEDROOM - FROM MIMI'S ANGLE
    
                   On the floor of the ornate bedroom, Julia Wolfe's dead 
                   body lies, stretched out.  She has been shot.  She is 
                   dressed as she was when she answered Mimi's telephone call.
    
                                                                    BACK TO:
    
                   REVERSE CLOSEUP - MIMI IN DOORWAY
    
                   For a minute, Mimi stands in the doorway looking down at 
                   the body, rooted to the spot with horror.  Then she looks 
                   around for the telephone, sees it beside the bed, and rushes 
                   to it, CAMERA PANNING.
    
                                         MIMI
                                  (telephoning)
                             Quick! Quick! Send somebody up 
                             here right away.  Something terrible 
                             has happened!
    
                   She replaces the receiver.  For a second, she stands still, 
                   her back to the body.  But her curiosity finally overcomes 
                   her terror, and she goes slowly back toward the body.
    
                   She stands looking down at Julia, a million speculations 
                   and suspicions going through her mind.  Suddenly her eye 
                   fastens on something in the dead woman's outflung hand. 
                   Her eyes widen with horror.  She makes up her mind to take 
                   the object, which we do not see. Looking around quickly to 
                   see if no one has come in, she reaches down, takes it from 
                   the girl's hand, and stuffs it in her hand bag.  She 
                   straightens up, CAMERA PANNING QUICKLY UP FOR:
    
                   CLOSEUP OF MIMI.
    
                   She stands clutching her bag, her eyes wide with horror at 
                   the realization of what that piece of evidence means.  She 
                   is trying to formulate a plan of action as we:

                   HOMICIDE BUREAU - POLICE HEADQUARTERS.
    
                   Several officers are sitting around talking.
    
                                         1ST OFFICER
                             The way these dames get by with 
                             things makes me sick.
    
                   The telephone rings.  Another officer answers the telephone.
    
                                         2ND OFFICER
                             Yeah? -- Julia Wolfe, 145 West 55.

                             Here you are.
    
                   He gives the officer the paper.

                             What is it?

                             That's more like it.
    
                   The 1st officer goes quickly out.

                   Macaulay is sitting at a flat desk, with some papers in 
                   front of him.  A stenographer is taking dictation.  The 
                   inter-office communicator buzzes.  Macaulay leans over 
                   pulls the switch and listens.  A girl's voice comes over 
                   the communicator.
    
                                         GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)

                   SPEAKEASY - CLOSE SHOT OF NUNHEIM AND MARIAN.
    
                   They are in a booth at a speakeasy.  Marian is a big-boned, 
                   full-fleshed, red-haired woman of about twenty-eight, 
                   handsome in a rather brutal, sloppy way.  Nunheim has a 
                   satisfied smile on his face.
    
                                         MARIAN
                             Where you been?
    
                   A waiter comes and puts two beers in front of them.  He 
                   stands waiting to be paid.
    
                                         NUNHEIM
                             Out making some money.
    
                                         MARIAN

                                  hand)
                             Let's see it.

                             I haven't got it yet.
    
                   Marian gives him a dirty look and takes a quarter out of 
                   her purse and throws it down to pay the waiter for the 
                   beers.

                   Two old wispy cleaning women in aprons with pass keys on 
                   thin belts are standing talking with their heads together 
                   outside of Julia's apartment.
    
                                         1ST CLEANING WOMAN
                                  (almost whispering)
                             What're you goin' to tell 'em?
    
                                         2ND CLEANING WOMAN
                                  (wiping her forehead 
                                  with a dust cloth)
                             I guess you got to tell 'em 
                             everything.

                             Do you think Mr. Wynant....?
    
                                         2ND CLEANING WOMAN
                             All I know's they had an awful 
                             fight a while ago.
    
                   A police officer comes to the door of the apartment.  He 
                   beckons to them.
    
                                         POLICE OFFICER
                             All right, girls.
    
                   Without realizing the humor of the "girls", they start in.
    
                                                              SLIDE OVER TO:
    
                   STUDSY'S CABARET - FULL SHOT.
    
                   It is in a flashy Broadway cabaret.  On the dance floor 
                   about ten girls in practice clothes are rehearsing a new 
                   routine.  A man is mechanically playing the piano for them.  
                   Several waiters are decorating the room with greens and 
                   Christmas wreaths.  It is late afternoon, and the place 
                   has no customers in it.  The chairs are piled on the tables.  
                   Morelli is sitting at a table.  The waiter is placing a 
                   bottle of Scotch and a glass before him.  Studsy comes up 
                   to the table.  Studsy is a powerfully built man of about 
                   fifty who looks forty.  He is a little fat now, but not 
                   soft.  Morelli looks up as he comes to the table.  CAMERA 
                   MOVES UP FOR CLOSE SHOT ON THEM.
    
                                         MORELLI
                             How'yer, Studsy.
    
                   He starts to pour a drink.
    
                                         STUDSY
                                  (looking at Morelli 
                                  very closely)
                             Diden you know Julia Wolfe?
    
                                         MORELLI
                                  (a guarded tone in 
                                  his voice)
                             Yeah.
    
                                         STUDSY
                             Somebody just bumped her off  I 
                             thought you'd like to know.
    
                   Studsy walks away.  Morelli slowly drinks his liquor, his 
                   eyes fixed on space, thinking hard.
    
                                                              SLIDE OVER TO:
    
                   JULIA'S BEDROOM AGAIN - MEDIUM SHOT.
    
                   The Medical Examiner, Dr. Walton, is leaning over Julia's 
                   body.  An officer is sitting in front of Julia's desk, 
                   looking through her papers and letters and throwing them 
                   to one side as he reads them.  John Guild, a burly, laconic,

                             When was the last time you gave 
                             her money for Wynant?

                             Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand 
                             dollars.

                             Perhaps it was a robbery.

                             And her with that sparkler on her 
                             hand, and thirty dollars in her 
                             purse?  Looks to me like our friend 
                             Wynant came to collect and ran 
                             into a little trouble.

                             see in this place.

                   An officer comes from the living room.

                   Mimi is in the midst of telling her experience.
    
                   Gilbert, Dorothy and Jorgensen are listening.
    
                   Mimi still has her hat and coat on.  She has just come in.  
                   She is seated, on the edge of her chair, enjoying the 
                   recital.  Jorgensen stands at the window.

                             and there she was lying dead.  The 
                             police said she'd probably been 
                             killed about ten minutes before I

                             The police.  I thought you said

                             present.
    
                   The thought that the police might come to the apartment 
                   increases his fear.

                             Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at 
                             the Public Library.

                             Where were you?
    
                                         MIMI

                   At that minute the front door bell rings.
    
                   Mimi looks toward the door, wondering who it is.

                   He goes quickly out.
    
                   HALLWAY OUTSIDE JORGENSEN APARTMENT.
    
                   Guild and Bill are standing outside the door of the 
                   Jorgensen's apartment.  Gilbert opens the door of the 
                   apartment.

                             Is Mrs. Jorgensen in?
    
                                         GILBERT
                                  (delighted to see 
                                  then)
                             Yes, come right in!
    
                   The two officers go in and the door closes behind them.  
                   From a door beyond, the service door of the apartment, 
                   Jorgensen comes out, putting on his hat and coat as he 
                   comes.  He doesn't wait for the elevator but starts down 
                   the stairs.
    
                   LIVING ROOM - JORGENSEN'S APARTMENT
    
                   Guild is seated uncomfortably on one of Mimi's delicate 
                   chairs, opposite Mimi.  Gilbert is standing, listening 
                   eagerly.  Dorothy sits nearby, her mind deeply occupied.
    
                   Mimi is a little frightened, but she hides it under a 
                   pretense of wanting to do all she can to help.  Dorothy 
                   sits listening.

                             There are a few things we want to 
                             check up on.
    
                                         MIMI

                             the body from the time you 
                             discovered it 'til we came?
    
                                         MIMI
                             Why yes.

                             Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's 
                             hand?
    
                                         MIMI

                             room...  that one of the bellhops 
                             or maids might not have been in 
                             there alone?

                             I don't think so.  Of course I was 
                             terribly upset...  I hardly knew 
                             what I was doing.

                             The Medical Examiner seems to think 
                             that the body was touched.  He 
                             says it looks as if the girl's 
                             hand had been forced open after 
                             she was killed....

                   She is listening intently.

                             thousand dollars the night before.
    
                   Dorothy looks toward her Mother, her eyes wide with horror.
    
                                         MIMI'S VOICE (O.S.)
                             I'm sorry I can't help you.

                   Guild and Bill come out, followed by Gilbert. 
                   Guild goes to the elevator and rings the bell.
    
                                         GILBERT
                             Could I go down and see the body? 
                             I've never seen a dead body.

                             criminology.  I have a theory.  
                             Perhaps this as the work of a sadist 
                             or a paranoiac.  If I saw it, I 
                             might be able to tell.
    
                   The elevator comes up.

                             That's a good idea.  But don't you 
                             bother to come down.  We'll bring 
                             the body right up here.

                             Come on, Bill.

                   The door is closed behind her.  She goes to a small wall 
                   safe and opens it.  Then she opens her bag and is about to 
                   put the thing she took from Julia's hand wrapped in a 
                   handkerchief, into the safe, when she is startled by 
                   Dorothy's voice.

                             None of your business.
    
                   Dorothy comes up to her mother and speaks accusingly.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             You took that money from Julia's 
                             hand.

                   with blood.  Dorothy looks at it, and recognizes it with 
                   horror.

                   LIVING ROOM - NICK'S APARTMENT.
    
                   It is eight o'clock the same night...  about two hours 
                   later.
    
                   There is a party in full swing.  It is an odd assortment 
                   of people.  There is a police captain there, a reminder of 
                   Nick's old life.  A little prizefight manager with a big 
                   fighter in tow.  Quinn, a dissipated looking man of about 
                   thirty-five, and his wife, a rather faded woman of about 
                   thirty-two, very jealous of Friend Husband.  Quinn is a 
                   broker, and the only one in evening clothes.  Then there 
                   is Foster, a big fat man, who sits near the radio, a glass 
                   in his hand.  With every sip, he grows more sentimental, 
                   as he listens to the program of Christmas carols that are 
                   coming over the radio.  There is an improvised bar with 
                   everything in the way of liquors and necessary 
                   accompaniments on it.  Nick is moving among the people, 
                   seeing that they are served.  Nick goes over to Mrs. Quinn, 
                   giving her one of the drinks he is carrying.  Mrs. Quinn 
                   is looking around rather fearfully at the curious assortment 
                   of people in the room.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (giving her a drink)
                             How are you doing?
    
                                         MRS. QUINN
                                  (looking around 
                                  disapprovingly)
                             Who are they, Nick?
    
                                         NICK
                                  (easily)
                             All my old friends.
    
                   He smiles and passes on to another group.  Among them is a 
                   very rough looking man with a battered face.  He turns to 
                   grin at Nick showing a mouth with several teeth missing.
    
                                         THE MAN
                             Hey, Nick.  I think your wife's 
                             great.
    
                                         NICK
                             Thanks.  I wanted you to see her...  
                             and I wanted her to see you.
    
                   Nick goes on to speak to the Police Captain who is standing 
                   talking to a very distinguished looking woman, in evening 
                   clothes.
    
                                         POLICE CAPTAIN
                                  (to Nick)
                             It's like old times, Nick.  Remember 
                             the fun we used to have when we 
                             were both flat broke?
    
                                         NICK
                             Do I!
    
                                         POLICE CAPTAIN
                                  (with a sentimental 
                                  sigh)
                             Those were the good old days.
    
                                         NICK
                             Don't kid yourself.  These are the 
                             good old days.
    
                   Nick goes on his way to another group.
    
                   The CAMERA PANS OVER TO NORA at the door.
    
                   She opens it to admit Face Peppler.  He is a tough-looking 
                   ex-convict.  He looks eagerly around the room.
    
                                         PEPPLER
                             Nick Charles here?

                             Nick!

                                         NORA
                             Yes.

                                  approving pat on

                             He sent me up the river once.

                                  greets him)

                   Peppler It's a long time I don't see you.

                                         PEPPLER
                             I wouldn't know.  That time he 
                             caught me was a accident.  I led 
                             with my right.

                             Come on.  Have a drink.
    
                   He takes Peppler by the arm out of the scene as WE PAN 
                   NORA TO THE TELEPHONE.  She picks up the receiver, her 
                   eyes on the odd mixture of people assembled.

                   Nick is pouring a drink for Face.  The little prizefight 
                   manager comes up to him with a great hulk of a fighter in 
                   tow.  (The contrast in sizes is amusing.)
    
                                         MANAGER
                             Like to buy a piece of this pug,

                             Is he good?

                             He's been knocking 'em cold.  He 
                             ain't afraid of nobody.
                                  (the fighter reaches 
                                  for a drink.  The

                             Drop that, or I'll slug you.
    
                   The fighter, cowed, meekly puts down the drink.  Nick 
                   laughs, hands Peppler a drink.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (to Peppler)

                             I got it before repeal.
    
                   The girl in very beautiful evening clothes with a string 
                   of pearls around her neck comes over to Nick and Peppler.  
                   She holds out the pearls for Nick's attention.
    
                                         GIRL
                             Look, Nick.  Remember?  These are 
                             the ones you got back for me.
    
                   Peppler looks at them with a professionally avaricious 
                   eye.

                   Suddenly the music of the radio stops as it is switched to 
                   another station.  The voice of a news broadcaster comes 
                   over.

                   He goes off toward the service pantry with the drink in 
                   his hand.

                             Sure.  He's working on a case of 
                             Scotch.  Pitch in and help him.
    
                   She goes off toward the service pantry.  Mrs. Quinn comes 
                   up with her glass.  Quinn looks appreciatingly after Nora.

                             hat to her.
    
                                         MRS, QUINN

                   SERVICE PANTRY
    
                   It is a tiny room with cupboards, a sink and a miniature 
                   Frigidaire.  Nick is getting ice cubes out of a tray.  
                   Nora comes in with a glass in her hand.
    
                                         NORA
                             I'd better order some food.
                                  (to Nick - as she 
                                  takes receiver)
                             That sounds like an interesting 
                             case.  Wouldn't you like to take 
                             it?

                             busy seeing that you don't lose 
                             any of the money I married you

                   She talks to Nick as she waits to get the connection.  She 
                   watches him covertly as she she is sure that he would love 
                   to go back to "sleuthing", and she'd enjoy being in on it 
                   with him...she is trying to sound him out.

                             knows who did it.  They haven't 
                             found any clues yet -- no gun --

                                  and suddenly

                                  is getting

                             it.
    
                   He picks up the ice and Nora's drink.
    
                                         NORA
                             Isn't that my drink?

                   Nick drains the glass and puts it down.

                             Yeah -- that's yours.
    
                   He walks out as Nora turns laughing to the telephone.

                   Nick comes in with the ice.  The doorbell rings.  Nick 
                   puts down the ice and starts for the door. As the CAMERA 
                   TRUCKS with him he passes the telephone table.  Foster is 
                   sitting there.  The radio music has put him in a sentimental 
                   mood.
    
                                         FOSTER

                   CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN WITH HIM as he goes on to the door.  
                   Just as he is about to open it, he hears Foster's voice, 
                   o.s.
    
                                         FOSTER

                   Nick looks off, winces a little, good-humoredly. Then he 
                   opens the door and is surprised to see Dorothy Wynant 
                   standing there.  She is white-lipped, miserable and 
                   desperate.  Nick looks at her, a little worried by her 
                   harassed look.
    
                                         NICK
                             Come on in.

                             I've got to see you alone!
    
                   Nick realizes that something is definitely the matter.
    
                                         QUINN (VOICE O.S.)
                             Hello, beautiful!
    
                   Nick turns as he hears Quinn's voice.
    
                   FULL SHOT -- GUESTS AND REPORTERS.
    
                   Quinn is coming toward them, a drink in his hand.  His 
                   eyes are fixed on Dorothy.  The two reporters also are 
                   coming forward.  Their curiosity quite different from 
                   Quinn's, for they realize her identity and the possibili- 
                   ties of a story.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (rushing her toward 
                                  the bedroom)
                             Go on in there.
    
                   He opens the door and she goes in.  Nick is about to follow 
                   her when Quinn stops him.
    
                                         QUINN
                             Who's the little blonde?
    
                                         NICK
                             Used to bounce it on my knee.
    
                                         QUINN
                             Which knee?  Could I touch it?
    
                   Nick laughs and enters the bedroom.  Quinn tries to follow, 
                   as do the reporters who have come up, but Nick shuts the 
                   door in their faces.  Quinn, startled, knocks on the door.
    
                                         QUINN

                   BEDROOM.
    
                   Dorothy is standing near the bed.  She holds herself taut 
                   and stiff.  She is determined that she is going to sacrifice 
                   herself to save her father.  Nick comes up to her.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             You heard about Julia Wolf?
    
                                         NICK
                             Yes.

                                  from her muff)
                             There.

                                  then back at her.

                             Yes.  I hated her for coming between 
                             my mother and father.  She kept me 
                             from seeing my father.  I went 
                             down there to ask her where he 
                             was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I 
                             shot her.

                   Dorothy breaks down, realizing that her attempt to take 
                   the blame is futile.  Nick goes and holds her comfortingly 
                   in his arms.

                                         NICK
                             Don't lie to me.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             That's the truth.
    
                   At this point Nora enters.  She holds a drink in her hand.  
                   Nick looks up -- makes a little grimace at Nora.  Dorothy 
                   turns and sees her.  She pulls away a little.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             This is awful of me -- to make a 
                             nuisance of myself.
    
                                         NORA
                                  (easily)
                             Don't be a dope.  Have a drink?
    
                   Dorothy tries wanly to smile.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             No thanks.
    
                   She fumbles in her bag to find her powder.  Nick is looking 
                   curiously at the gun, turning it over in his hand.
    
                                         NORA
                                  (to Dorothy -- 
                                  pointing to dressing 
                                  table)
                             There's powder and stuff over there.
    
                   Dorothy walks toward the table.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (looking up -- 
                                  indicating drink 
                                  Nora has)
                             Make her take that.
    
                   Nora sees the gun now, is amazed.
    
                                         NORA
                             Where did you get that?
    
                                         NICK
                                  (indicating Dorothy)
                             She brought it in.
                                  (slips it into the 
                                  drawer of a table)
                             Trying to make me believe she did 
                             it.
    
                                         NORA
                                  (as he puts the gun 
                                  away)
                             What are you going to do with it?
    
                                         NICK
                             Nothing, 'til I find out if it's 
                             the gun Julia Wolf was killed with.
                                  (he starts for the 
                                  door to the living 
                                  room)
                             Keep her in here, and don't let 
                             those reporters see her. They might 
                             believe her.
    
                   He goes out the door, and closes it hastily behind him.  
                   Nora goes toward Dorothy.
    
                   LIVING ROOM
    
                   There is a hotel service table, piled high with food, in 
                   the room.  The people here all eating, standing around 
                   with drinks in their hands.  As soon as Nick opens the 
                   door to come out, the reporters pounce on him.
    
                                         FIRST REPORTER
                             Isn't that Dorothy Wynant?
    
                                         NICK
                             Yes.
                                  (the first reporter 
                                  makes a move to go 
                                  past Nick to the

                             Here...here.  She doesn't know 
                             anything about it.
    
                                         SECOND REPORTER
                             And you said you weren't on the 
                             case.
    
                   He goes off quickly toward the telephone.
    
                                         NICK
                             I'm not.  I don't know a thing 
                             about it, and I don't care a thing 
                             about it.  All I want is a drink.
    
                   Foster has at last been able to get his mother in San 
                   Francisco.
    
                                         FOSTER
                                  (on the phone)
                             Hello, Ma.
    
                   The reporter comes rapidly into the shot.  He tries to 
                   take the telephone from the other man.
    
                                         REPORTER
                             Give me that.
    
                                         FOSTER
                                  (holding on to it, 
                                  protesting)
                             But I just got San Francisco ...

                                         REPORTER
                                  (taking the phone 
                                  from him, he speaks

                             got some business.

                                  hook for the

                   CLOSE SHOT AT TABLE
    
                   Quinn is standing beside Nick.  The doorbell rings.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (to reporter over 
                                  at telephone)
                             Hey, don't do that!
                                  (he is pouring a 
                                  drink)
                             Now don't tell your paper that I'm 
                             working on anything, 'cause I'm 
                             not.
    
                   Nick goes offscene toward the door.  The bell rings again.
    
                                         QUINN
                             He's just working on that little 
                             gal.
    
                   FULL SHOT.
    
                   Nick opens the door.  Mimi and Gilbert are outside. Mimi 
                   instantly rushes in greets him effusively. Gilbert is left 
                   standing in the door.
    
                                         MIMI
                             Oh, Nick... Nick!
    
                                         NICK
                             Hello, Mimi.
    
                                         MIMI
                             want to talk to you about something 
                             very important.
    
                   The first reporter has forgotten his telephone call. He is 
                   all ears.  Nick looks around desperately, and takes Mimi 
                   roughly by the arm and rushes her into a doorway next to 
                   the door of the bedroom.
    
                                         NICK
                             Come on in here.
    
                   BATHROOM.
    
                   As Nick brings Mimi into the bathroom, she looks around; 
                   bewildered.
    
                                         NICK
                             Sorry.  This is the only place we 
                             can be alone; Won't you sit down?
    
                   He waves airily off scene, presumably toward the seat, 
                   Mimi follows the line of his hand, looks, starts and gives 
                   him a cutting look.
    
                   DOORWAY OF LIVING ROOM.
    
                   Gilbert is standing hesitantly in the doorway. The first 
                   reporter suddenly sees him.  He hasn't noticed him before.  
                   He goes quickly to him.
    
                                         FIRST REPORTER
                             How do you do, Mr. Wynant.
                                  (he takes Gilbert 
                                  cordially but firmly 
                                  by the arm and 
                                  brings him into 
                                  the room)
                             My name is Diamond. Come on in and 
                             have a drink.
    
                                         GILBERT
                             I don't drink.
    
                                         FIRST REPORTER
                             As a matter-of-fact, I don't either. 
                             I'd much rather talk...
    
                   He starts for a quiet corner -
    
                                                                    BACK TO:
    
                   BATHROOM.
    
                   Mimi and Nick are sitting on the edge of the tub.
    
                                         MIMI
                             Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely 
                             crazy to stay away at a time like 
                             this. No wonder the police think 
                             he has something to do with it.
    
                                         NICK
                             What do you think?
    
                                         MIMI
                             Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I 
                             could find him...  I have something 
                             very important to tell him.  
                             Macaulay won't help at all.  He 
                             thinks I just want money.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (smiling at her)
                             Well, don't you?
    
                                         MIMI
                                  (choosing to regard 
                                  this as a joke)
                             You're always teasing.
    
                   The door of the bathroom opens.  Foster starts to come in. 
                   He stops suddenly as he sees Mimi.
    
                                         FOSTER
                             I beg your pardon.
    
                   He backs hurriedly out.  Mimi moves closer to Nick, takes 
                   his arm.
    
                                         MIMI
                             Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- 
                             won't you?
    
                                         NICK
                             Now, Mimi, there are a thousand 
                             detectives in New York.  Hire one 
                             of them.
    
                                         MIMI
                                  (persuasively)
                             But he knows you.  All you have to

                             tell him that Mimi says everything 
                             is all right... but that I've got 
                             to see him.
    
                                         NICK
                             I tell you again, I don't want any 
                             part of it.
                                  (he goes and opens 
                                  the door which 
                                  connects with the 
                                  bedroom)
                             Now you take Dorothy home and...
    
                                         MIMI
                                  (furious)
                             Dorothy!  Is she here?
    
                                         NICK
                                  (startled by her 
                                  tone)
                             Yes...
    
                   Mimi pushes into the bedroom, past him.
    
                   BEDROOM - MEDIUM GROUP
    
                   Dorothy and Nora are sitting on the bed.
    
                   Asta is between them.  Dorothy is patting Asta, still 
                   looking very subdued and unhappy.  Nora holds out the glass 
                   toward her.
    
                                         NORA
                             If you finish this, you'll feel 
                             better.
    
                   In the mirror in back of them, we see Mimi coming toward 
                   Dorothy, a look of fury on her face.  Dorothy looks up at 
                   her Mother as she comes into the  scene, a little terrified 
                   by her Mother's expression.  Mimi comes right to Dorothy 
                   and stands over her.  She is sure that Dorothy has told 
                   Nick about the watch chain.
    
                                         MIMI
                             What did you tell him?  What did 
                             you tell him?
    
                   Dorothy doesn't answer.  Her Mother slaps her viciously, 
                   repeating the question.  Nick comes up from behind Mimi 
                   and pulls her away.  Nora puts a protecting arm around 
                   Dorothy.  There is a second of silence as Dorothy and Mimi 
                   face each other, all of their mutual antagonism in their 
                   eyes.  Asta starts barking.  Nora quiets him.
    
                                         NICK
                             She didn't tell me a thing.
    
                                         NORA
                                  (drily to Mimi)
                             Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
    
                                         MIMI
                                  (recovering herself)
                             I'm so excited I didn't know what 
                             I was doing.  Come on, Dorothy, 
                             we'll go home.
    
                                         NORA
                                  (sharply to Mimi)
                             She'll go home if she wants to.
                                  (she turns with 
                                  warm affection to 
                                  Dorothy)
                             You can stay here you know.  There's 
                             plenty of room and we'd love to 
                             have you.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             Thanks.  But I'll go home.
    
                   She stands up to go.  Mimi looks around.
    
                                         MIMI
                             Where's Gilbert?
    
                                         NICK
                                  (this is the last 
                                  straw)
                             Gilbert!  Is he here too?
                                  (he starts toward 
                                  the living room)
                             We might as well be living in the 
                             lobby.
    
                   Gilbert is sitting in a corner of the room with the two 
                   reporters.  They have their pencils out, taking down the 
                   rapid flow of words that come from Gilbert.
    
                                         GILBERT
                             There's a physiological as well as 
                             a psychological angle in my father's 
                             relationship with Julia Wolf that 
                             the police have overlooked.  And I 
                             think it explains everything.  You 
                             see, my father was a sexogenarian.

                                         GILBERT
                             Why not?

                                         GILBERT
                             Then just say he was sixty years 
                             old.
    
                                         1ST REPORTER

                             Of course.
    
                   The reporter gets up, furious.  He throws his pad to the 
                   floor.  Nick comes into the scene.  He goes to Gilbert.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (to Gilbert - amused

                   He takes Gilbert by the arm and pushes him into the bedroom 
                   and closes the door on him.  The telephone starts to ring. 
                   The two reporters follow Nick as he goes toward the 
                   telephone.
    
                                         2ND REPORTER
                             Come on.... give me a break.  You 
                             owe it to me after that.
    
                                         NICK
                             I swear I haven't a thing to do 
                             with it.

                   BIG CLOSEUP - NUNHEIM AT A TELEPHONE.
    
                   He is in a room telephoning.  The background is not 
                   distinguishable.  He is evidently talking for the effect 
                   on someone else in the room whom we do not see.  He looks 
                   at the man out of the corner or his eye as he talks.
    
                                         NUNHEIM
                             Mr. Charles, I'd like to lay a 
                             proposition before you.  I can't 
                             discuss it over the telephone, but 
                             if you'll give me half an hour of 
                             your time... it's about the Julia 
                             Wolf....
    
                   At that a hand comes in, covers the mouthpiece, preventing 
                   any further conversation.  Nunheim, still in this BIG 
                   CLOSEUP, looks o.s, at the invisible man and grins 
                   sardonically.
    
                                                                    BACK TO:

                   Then as he gets no answer, he hangs up.  The 2nd reporter 
                   jumps to him.

                   WIDE ANGLE - THE ROOM
    
                   Nora comes out of the bedroom door.  Quinn comes up to 
                   her.  Mrs. Quinn, starts listening.

                             Out the back way.
    
                   The two reporters, without a word, grab their hats and 
                   coats and rush out. Quinn, too, brazenly starts to breeze 
                   past his wife and follow them.  Mrs. Quinn steps in front 
                   of him, slaps his face. Foster, again at the phone, whines 
                   out:  "Hello, Ma!"  And simultaneously, during this 
                   confusion, the radio starts to play "Silent Night, Peaceful 
                   Night" -- as the police captain, the pug, Face Peppler, 
                   and all others immediately join in with the song.  They 
                   are all pretty tight by this time and sing at the top of 
                   their lungs.  The effect desired is a screwy climax to 
                   what has been quite a hectic, screwy situation. CAMERA 
                   PANS WITH NORA as she takes it all in at a quick glance 
                   and walks over to Nick. She puts her arms around him.  He 
                   looks down at her, amused.
    
                   CAMERA MOVES UP FOR A BIG CLOSEUP OF THE TWO.
    
                                         NORA
                             I love you, Nickie, 'cause you 
                             know such lovely people!

                   It is about an hour later the bedroom is dark for a second. 
                   Then, Nora on one side of the big double bed, pulls on the 
                   light on the small table beside her. She sits up a little 
                   and looks over at Nick. He is soundly sleeping, his face 
                   toward her. She has Dorothy on her mind and can't sleep 
                   and she wants company.
    
                                         NORA

                   CAMERA PULLS BACK as he gets up out of bed and goes to the 
                   bureau where there is a bottle and a glass. Asta jumps 
                   down and follows him. Nick pours himself a drink. Asta 
                   stands there, licking Nick's bare feet.

                   Nora is determined to get Nick to help Dorothy.  She tries 
                   another approach.

                             killed Julia and Dorothy knows it.

                   He brings her the drink.  She takes it from him and he 
                   gets into bed.

                             The man at the Aquarium said that 
                             he wouldn't take them back.
    
                   Nora looks over at him, disgusted. She puts down the drink 
                   and pulls out the light.  After a second, there is a knock 
                   heard from the next room. Nora pulls on the light. She 
                   turns to Nick.
    
                                         NORA
                             Did you hear a knock?
    
                   Nick looks up.  The knock comes again.  Nora gets up, takes 
                   a robe from the foot of the bed, pulls it on and goes out.  
                   As she does so, Nick reaches over, takes her drink and 
                   finishes it, then turns over again to go to sleep.
    
                   DOOR OF LIVING ROOM,
    
                   Nora has put on the lights as she came through the room.  
                   She opens the door. Joe Morelli is standing outside. He 
                   wears a black derby hat, which he doesn't remove and he 
                   has his hands in the pockets of his close fitting black 
                   over-coat. Nora looks at him with lively curiosity.  She 
                   is too fond of adventure as well as too brave to scream 
                   when she sees his menacing figure.
    
                                         MORELLI
                             Mr. Charles here?

                             But I gotta do that.
    
                   Nora looks at him for a second.
    
                                         NORA
                             You wait here.  I'll tell him.
    
                   She goes toward the bedroom.
    
                                                                     CUT TO:
    
                   THE BEDROOM.
    
                   Nora enters, calling to Nick.
    
                                         NORA
                             Nick!  Nick!
                                  (Nick stirs and 
                                  opens his eyes)
                             There's someone to she you,
    
                                         NICK
                                  (sitting up)
                             That's great.  I was afraid I'd 
                             have to go to sleep.
    
                   But as Nora moves away to get back into bed, we see Morelli 
                   has followed her into the bedroom and is standing pointing 
                   a gun directly at Nick, with a menacing intentness in his 
                   whole body.
    
                   WIDE ANGLE - THE GROUP.
    
                   Nora, entirely unconscious of Morelli's presence and the 
                   gun in his hand, swings into bed beside Nick.  Nick is 
                   looking fixedly at the gun.  Nora looks at him, amused by 
                   his expression, not knowing the cause.
    
                                         NORA
                             You've got the funniest look on 
                             your face.
    
                   She follows the line of Nick's gaze, and her eyes pop with 
                   amazement as she sees Morelli with the gun.
    
                   REVERSE ANGLE - CLOSEUP ON MORELLI.
    
                   He holds the gun leveled at Nick.
    
                                         MORELLI
                             I gotta talk to you.  I want you 
                             to tell me something and I want 
                             you to give it to me straight.  
                             Get me?

                             Do you mind putting that gun away?  
                             My wife doesn't care, but I'm in a 
                             delicate condition.
    
                                                                     CUT TO:

                   his danger.

                   but apparently not frightened.

                             That's all swell.  Only you're 
                             peddling your fish in the wrong 
                             market. I've got nothing to do

                             you. But listen...  What's the law 
                             doing to me?  Do they think I did 
                             it, or is it just something else

                             I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm 
                             not in this.  Ask the police.

                   Over the SOUND TRACK there is a sound of knuckles rapping 
                   sharply on the door.  Morelli's gun is in his hand before 
                   the rapping stops.  His eyes seem to move in all directions 
                   at once.

                             This is your party.
    
                   The sound of the knuckles come again, and someone speaks 
                   outside.
    
                                         GUILD'S VOICE (O.S.)
                             Open up.  Police.
    
                                         MORELLI
                                  (as he raises his 
                                  gun to fire at 
                                  Nick)
                             You two-timing --
    
                   Nick shoves Nora's face, knocking her out of bed and across 
                   the room with his left hand, and throws a pillow at Morelli 
                   with his right just as Morelli fires.  Nick sprawls out of 
                   bed, making a dive for Morelli and catching his ankle. The 
                   two men fall to the floor. Morelli clubs Nick with his 
                   revolver, and Nick fights him with his one free hand.
    
                   Guild, two policemen, and the hotel manager rush into the 
                   room.  They pitch in and drag Nick and Morelli apart.
    
                   CLOSE SHOT -- NORA ON FLOOR
    
                   She is in a faint as Nick, comes quickly up to her.  The 
                   hotel manager follows him and stands looking down 
                   solicitously. Nick leans down over her.
    
                                         NICK
                             Nora.....Nora!
    
                   She doesn't move.
    
                   Hotel Manager What knocked her out?
    
                                         NICK
                             I did. She was in the line of fire.
                                  (turns, points to 
                                  liquor bottle)
                             Hand me that bottle.
                                  (turns back to Nora, 
                                  begins working on 
                                  her)
                             Better get a doctor.
    
                   The hotel manager goes quickly out. Nick tries to get Nora 
                   to take a drink of whisky.  She opens her eyes. She puts 
                   her hand up to her cheek where Nick hit her.  Then, as 
                   Nick watches her anxiously:
    
                                         NORA
                                  (indignantly)
                             You darn fool -- you didn't have 
                             to knock me out.  I knew you'd 
                             take him, but I wanted to see you 
                             do it!
    
                   FULL SHOT -- INCLUDING GUILD, MORELLI AND TWO OFFICERS
    
                   Morelli is standing handcuffed between the officers.  Guild 
                   looks admiringly at Nora as Nick is helping her to her 
                   feet.

                             There's a gal with hair on her 
                             chest.
    
                   As Nick pulls Nora up, she looks at the coat of his pyjamas, 
                   where a streak of blood has started to come through.
    
                                         NORA
                                  (for the first, 
                                  time horrified)
                             Nick... you're...
    
                   Nick follows her eyes down. For the first time he realizes 
                   that the bullet has touched him.
    
                                         NICK
                             It's all right.  It just grazed 
                             me.
    
                                         NORA

                                         NORA
                             Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are 
                             you all right?
    
                                         NICK
                                  (going toward the 
                                  bed)
                             Sure -- I don't even feel it.
    
                                         NORA
                             I'll get some towels.
                                  (she goes quickly 
                                  into the bathroom)
    
                   Nick gets into bed.  Guild comes over - looks at the wound.  
                   The CAMERA PANS AWAY from Morelli.

                   Over the SOUND TRACK we hear the policeman slap Morelli's 
                   mouth.
    
                   Nora comes back from the bathroom with some towels.  Nick 
                   puts a towel over the wound, and sits propped up in bed.
    
                                         NICK

                             fuss till the doctor comes.
    
                                         NORA

                             around in case the old man himself 
                             shows up.  Then we seen him...

                   The policeman starts to search the room.  Guild decides to 
                   change his tactics.
    
                                         GUILD
                             Listen, Mr. Charles.  I guess we're 
                             both of us going about this wrong.  
                             I don't want to get tough with 
                             you, and I guess you don't want to 
                             get tough with me.
    
                   There's just one one question I want to ask you. Are you 
                   going to swear to the complaint of him shooting you?
    
                                         NICK
                             That's another one I can't answer 
                             right now. Maybe it was an accident.
    
                   Nora comes over with the drink for Nick.  She hands it to 
                   him, as she speaks.
    
                                         NORA

                                  Bob)
                             What's that man doing in my drawers?
    
                   Nick, hearing this, chokes on his drink.
    
                   BUREAU - CLOSEUP.
    
                   Bob is searching in the drawers of the bureau.  He finds 
                   the pistol that Nick left there and brings it to Guild. 
                   CAMERA PANS HIM OVER.
    
                                         BOB
                             Here you are, Lieutenant.
    
                   Guild takes the gun, looks at it and turns to Nick.  Nick - 
                   not knowing whether or not the gun is evidence, is slightly 
                   apprehensive.  He watches Guild closely.

                             Okay.  There's plenty of time. I 
                             guess we got to ask you a lot more 
                             questions than we counted on.

                   As the dog comes slowly out from under the bureau, looking 
                   a little scared and shame-faced.  He comes toward Nick, 
                   jumps on the bed beside him and licks his face.

                   Nick throws a pillow at her.
    
                                                                 QUICK FADE:
    
                   FADE IN:
    
                   CLOSEUP OF CHRISTMAS TREE.
    
                   It is noon. The sun is streaming in. Most of the bells on 
                   the Christmas tree have been broken. There is one large 
                   ball still intact.  Over the SOUND TRACK we hear the pop 
                   of an air rifle.  The big ball splinters.
    
                   The CAMERA PULLS BACK to show Nick lying on the sofa in a 
                   dressing gown, with the air rifle in his hand.  He uses 
                   only his right hand on the rifle.  Across his chest, on 
                   the left, there is the indication of bandaging underneath 
                   his pajamas. On the floor beside him are piles of 
                   newspapers.  The telephone is on a table near his hand. 
                   The room is littered with tissue paper and ribbon from the 
                   opened Christmas presents. There is a breakfast table at 
                   one side, with the emptied dishes covered by a napkin.  
                   Nora is sitting smoking.  She is wearing a very lovely fur 
                   coat over her negligee.  She is reading a tabloid newspaper, 
                   the headlines and pictures of which exploit the Julia Wolf 
                   murder.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (looking fondly at 
                                  the rifle)
                             This is the nicest present I ever 
                             had.
    
                   Nora puts down her paper.  She comes over to Nick on the 
                   sofa.  She has a bunch of holiday telegrams in her hand. 
                   She starts to pick up the newspapers which almost cover 
                   Nick.  She has a very lovely wrist watch on.  Nick sees it -- 
                   takes her hand and examines it.
    
                                         NICK
                             I never saw that before.
    
                                         NORA
                             No.  It's a Christmas present.
    
                                         NICK
                             Who gave it to you?
    
                                         NORA
                             You did.
    
                                         NICK
                             You must admit I have good taste.
    
                   Nora laughs.
    
                                         NORA
                                  (indicating 
                                  newspapers)
                             Finished with these?
    
                                         NICK
                             Yes.  I know all they know about 
                             the murder. And I'm a great hero.  
                             The Tribune said I was shot twice.
    
                   As he talks, Nora throws the papers to the floor and sits 
                   down at the other end of the couch, putting her slippered 
                   feet comfortably in Nick's lap. She starts to open, the 
                   telegrams.
    
                                         NORA
                             I read you were shot five times in 
                             the tabloids.
    
                                         NICK
                             That's not true.  He never came 
                             near my tabloids.
                                  (he takes aim again 
                                  with his gun)
                             That's one thing I always protect... 
                             my tabloids.
    
                   As he is just ready to shoot, the CAMERA PANS over to his 
                   target.  It is a large balloon that Asta is chasing around 
                   the room.  We hear the "POP" of the RIFLE and the BALLOON 
                   EXPLODES, to Asta's astonishment and chagrin.  Asta starts 
                   looking for the lost balloon.
    
                                                                    BACK TO:
    
                   NICK AND NORA - CLOSEUP.
    
                   The telephone rings - Nick reaches over and picks it up.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (in phone)
                             Hello... send him up.
    
                                         NORA
                             Who's that?
    
                                         NICK
                             Macaulay.
    
                   Nora reads the telegrams and hands them to Nick at the 
                   other end of the sofa as she finishes.  He takes them as 
                   she gives them to him, and throws them on the floor without 
                   looking at them.
    
                                         NORA
                                  (as she reads one)
                             Season's Greetings.  The Mallorys.
                                  (she hands it to 
                                  Nick. She is 
                                  distressed)
                             I forgot all about them.
    
                   She opens another telegram.  Nick throws the first to the 
                   floor.  He looks at Nora in her fur coat.
    
                                         NICK
                             Aren't you hot in that?
    
                                         NORA
                             I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.
                                  (she hands him 
                                  another telegram)
                             The Kirbys.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (taking it and 
                                  dropping it on the 
                                  floor)
                             Is that another Christmas present?
    
                                         NORA
                                  (smiling at him)
                             Yes.
    
                                         NICK
                             Did I give it to you?
    
                                         NORA
                             Yes.
    
                   Again this is news to Nick, but he takes it philosophically.
    
                                         NICK
                             I'm spoiling you.
    
                   She tickles him with her foot.  Then she hands him another 
                   telegram, which suffers the same fate.  Nick cocks his gun 
                   again, preparing to shoot.  Nora has opened another 
                   telegram.  Her manner changes.

                   By this time she is at the door. She opens the door to 
                   Macaulay.
    
                                         NORA
                             Oh, hello.  Come on in.
    
                                         MACAULAY
                             Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't 
                             a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
    
                                         NORA
                             Oh, he's sitting up.
    
                                         MACAULAY
                             Good.
    
                   Macaulay comes in and goes to Nick.
    
                                         NICK
                             How are you?
    
                                         MACAULAY
                             I hate to bother you when you're 
                             laid up.
    
                                         NICK
                             That's all right.
    
                   Asta, delighted to see a visitor, jumps all over Macaulay. 
                   Macauley is a little disconcerted by all this attention.
    
                                         NORA
                             Asta!  Asta!  Come here.
    
                   She throws a ball and the dog chases it out of the scene. 
                   Macaulay sits down near Nick.
    
                   Asta comes back into the scene. He deposits the ball near 
                   Macaulay's chair and stands looking eagerly up at him.
    
                                         NORA
                             Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
    
                                         MACAULAY
                             That's all right.
    
                   He leans down and throws the ball for Asta.
    
                   Beside him on the floor is a miniature fire hydrant  He 
                   looks down at it.
    
                                         MACAULAY
                             What a delightful toy.
    
                   Nick looks down and sees it for the first time.
    
                                         NICK
                             Oh, it's a fire hydrant.
    
                                         NORA
                             Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present.
    
                   Macaulay, a little troubled, looks down at it, and then 
                   unostentatiously moves his leg and his chair out of the 
                   danger zone.  Asta returns, playfully and affectionately, 
                   with the ball again.  Macaulay, with a forced smile, throws 
                   it for him again.  Then Macaulay turns to Nick, reaching 
                   in his pocket for a telegram.
    
                                         MACAULAY
                             I got word from Wynant this 
                             morning...
    
                                         NORA
                             So did we.
                                  (correcting herself - 
                                  indicating Nick)
                             I mean, Sherlock here.
    
                   Nick hands Macaulay his telegram from Wynant.  Macaulay 
                   reads it and looks at Nick.
    
                                         MACAULAY
                             What are the chances of getting 
                             you to do what he wants?
    
                                         NICK
                             Slim.
    
                                         NORA
                             Oh, please, Nick.
    
                                         MACAULAY
                             Would it help any if I could 
                             persuade him to meet you?
    
                                         NICK
                             It might.
    
                                         MACAULAY
                             He gave me a code message to insert 
                             in the Times, in case I wanted to 
                             get in touch with him.
    
                                         NICK
                             It wouldn't hurt to put it in.
    
                   Nora beams. The telephone rings.  Nick picks it up.
    
                                         MACAULAY
                             I've done that already. He should 
                             appear, you know.  It doesn't look 
                             well... his staying away at a time 
                             like this.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (in telephone)
                             Hello.... oh, just a minute.
                                  (holding out the 
                                  phone to Macaulay)
                             Police department?
    
                                         MACAULAY
                                  (he looks surprised 
                                  but takes the phone)
                             Hello....
                                  (his face changes... 
                                  he is startled)
                             Where?  In Allentown.
                                  (he consults his 
                                  watch)
                             Yes... When is the next train?  
                             Right - I'll get that.
                                  (he slowly puts up 
                                  the phone and turns 
                                  to Nick and Nora)
                             Wynant's tried to commit suicide. 
                             They want me to come down and 
                             identify him.
                                  (slowly he picks up 
                                  his hat)
                             I guess this changes the whole 
                             story, doesn't it?  That looks 
                             like an admission of guilt.  And I 
                             had such hopes.  I thought if you 
                             got on the case, you'd be able to 
                             clear him.  I thought that Mimi.... 
                             the way she acted... I was sure 
                             that....
                                  (he sighs)
                             Oh, well, well... it's no use 
                             thinking of it now.  I'm sorry to 
                             have wasted so much of your time.
    
                   He goes quickly out.  Nora looks after him, and then turns 
                   to Nick.  She is evidently depressed.

                                  up off the sofa)

                             up.

                   Nick walks over to pour a drink.  Nora sits down and Asta 
                   comes and puts his head on her knees looking sadly up at 
                   her.

                             What's the trouble, Asta?  Your 
                             balloon busted?  So's mine.

                   As he strides into the bedroom, Nora striding in perfect 
                   imitation after him.
    
                                                                DISSOLVE TO:
    
                   EXTERIOR ENTRANCE, NORMANDIE HOTEL.
    
                   Nick and Nora come through the door.  They have Asta on a 
                   leash.  Guild steps up to them.

                             Good morning, Lieutenant -
                                  (Asta pulls her 
                                  violently toward 
                                  the curb. She goes 
                                  after him, out of 
                                  the scene, calling 
                                  back apologetically)
                             Sorry.
    
                   Guild and Nick follow Nora more slowly to the curb.
    
                                         GUILD
                                  (to Nick)
                             You oughtn't to play this trick on 
                             me.  Running out when I was giving 
                             you time to rest up before I asked 
                             you those questions.
    
                                         NICK
                             You mean about that gun?

                             That ain't a gun any more.  The

                             that.
    
                   They join Nora.  She listens eagerly, not taking her eyes 
                   from Nick and Guild. Through the whole scene, as they walk 
                   down the block, when Asta pulls on the leash Nora stops 
                   with him, and the two men, as a matter of course, stop and 
                   wait for Nora, none of them ever looking at Asta. (IT IS A 
                   TRUCKING SHOT ALL THE WAY)

                             want to know?
    
                   The leash tightens up and starts to pull Nora ahead.  The 
                   two men quicken their steps to keep pace with her.  (They 
                   are walking along a quiet street in the East Fifties, so 
                   that there is not much traffic, and not many people.)

                             even have to go down.

                             I thought it might be.  From now 
                             on, they're going to think that 
                             every thin man over six feet with 
                             white hair is Wynant.
    
                   Again the leash pulls Nora over to the curb.  The three, 
                   without interrupting their conversation, stand still, 
                   waiting.
    
                                         NORA

                             He shut up his apartment and his 
                             shop.

                             Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This 
                             is the way we figure it.  Wynant 
                             goes to Julia's apartment. He finds 
                             Morelli there... sees she's two-
                             timing him.  They have a fight. 
                             But he figures he don't want to do 
                             anything then.... Morelli might 
                             squeal.  So he goes away. He don't 
                             let his lawyer know anything has 
                             happened... he lets him go ahead 
                             and and hand over money to Julia 
                             to give to him, so that Julia will 
                             think it's all blown over. Then, 
                             when she don't expect it... he 
                             lets her have it.
    
                   Asta completes his investigation and starts off down the 
                   street again the three follow.

                   Asta sees another hydrant and makes for it.

                   She climbs determinedly in, pulling Asta after her.  Guild 
                   starts to follow, but Nick pulls him away.  He closes the 
                   door of the taxi and speaks to the driver:

                             Grant's Tomb.
    
                   The cab starts off.  Nora shakes her fist back at Nick. 
                   Nick charmingly lifts his hat and throws her a kiss, as 
                   Guild hails another passing cab.

                   OUTSIDE DOOR OF NUNHEIM'S APARTMENT.
    
                   It is the fourth floor of a dark, damp building.
    
                   The noise of the Sixth Avenue E1 can be heard even in the 
                   hallway.  Guild and Nick come to the door.  Guild knocks.  
                   There are sounds of hurried movement inside the room, then 
                   a voice calls, in an irritated tone.
    
                                         NUNHEIM'S VOICE (O.S.)

                   Nunheim hastily unlocks and opens the door.  He has no 
                   coat on - he is evidently frightened.

                   Guild touches Nick's elbow with his hand, and they go in.
    
                   LIVING ROOM OF APARTMENT.
    
                   The room is shabby and dirty, with clothing, newspapers 
                   and dirty dishes sitting around.  Through an open door, 
                   the bedroom, with an unmade bed, can be seen.  In an alcove 
                   there is a sink and a stove.  Marian is standing there 
                   with a sizzling skillet in her hand.
    
                   She is wearing a rumpled pink kimono and frayed pink mules 
                   with lop-sided bows on them.  She stares sullenly at Guild 
                   and Nick as they come in.  Guild does not introduce Nick 
                   to Nunheim, or even look at Marian.  He keeps his hat on, 
                   and Nick, seeing him, follows his example.  Guild pushes 
                   some clothing out of the way to make a place for himself 
                   at the end of the sofa.

                             Sit down.
    
                   Nick removes some newspaper from a rocking chair and sits 
                   down.  Nunheim goes over to a table where there is about 
                   two inches of whiskey in a pint bottle.
    
                                         NUNHEIM
                             Have a shot?

                             What's the idea of telling me you 
                             just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
    
                                         NUNHEIM
                             That's all I did, Lieutenant. That's 
                             the God's truth.  Maybe I said 
                             hello to her or how are you or 
                             something like that when I saw 
                             her, but that's all I knew her. 
                             That's the truth.
                                  (Marian laughs once, 
                                  derisively. But 
                                  there is no mirth 
                                  in her face. Nunheim 
                                  twists around to 
                                  face her)
                             All right.  Put your mouth in and 
                             I'll pop a tooth out of it.
    
                                         MARIAN
                             Is that so!
    
                   She swings her arm around and lets the skillet fly at his 
                   head.  It misses, crashing into the wall.  Nunheim starts 
                   after her.  Marian picks up a paring knife.  Nick puts his 
                   foot out, without rising, and trips him.  Nunheim falls to 
                   the floor.

                   Nunheim slowly gets up.  Marian starts for the bedroom 
                   without looking at any of them.
    
                                         NUNHEIM
                             She drives me nuts.  She's been

                   Marian comes out.  She is in street clothes and is carrying 
                   a suitcase.
    
                                         NUNHEIM

                   Marian starts for the outer door.  Nunheim tries to follow 
                   Marian, but Guild catches his arm.

                   he means and makes a bee line for the bedroom.  In a second 
                   he cones back. He takes the phone from Nick.

                   A TELEPHONE BOOTH.
    
                   Nunheim is talking into the telephone.  As he talks, he 
                   watches the outside of the telephone booth to be sure that 
                   no one is listening.  His voice is quiet but there is a 
                   menacing urgency in his tone.

                   STREET IN THE WEST FORTIES.
    
                   Nunheim jumps out of cab, pays the driver.
    
                   It drives off. The street is deserted. By this time it is 
                   about five o'clock and the early winter twilight has fallen.  
                   WE TRUCK AND PAN as Nunheim looks at the numbers of the 
                   houses.  A little way up the street he finds the number he 
                   has been looking for.  He walks into a dark doorway.  Just 
                   as he steps in, there is the crack of a pistol shot and 
                   the flash of fire from the gun. Nunheim throws up his hands, 
                   staggers forward to the street, his hand clutching his 
                   heart.  Here he pitches forward -- dead.  The CAMERA stays 
                   on the body.
    
                                                                DISSOLVE TO:
    
                   INSERT -- A BUNDLE OF CLOTHES -- ALL THAT IS LEFT OF ONE 
                   ARTHUR NUNHEIM!
    
                   The hands of Nick and Guild are examining the clothes as 
                   we come in. Nick has taken a card from the inside coat 
                   pocket.
    
                                         NICK'S VOICE
                                  (over insert of 
                                  card he holds)
                             "Arthur Nunheim -- Honorary member"
    
                   CAMERA PULLS BACK RAPIDLY NOW TO REVEAL GUILD'S OFFICE AT 
                   POLICE HEADQUARTERS.
    
                   Guild is throwing down some letters and stuff he has 
                   extricated.
    
                                         GUILD
                             Not a thing.
    
                   Bob, the policeman, comes in.
    
                                         GUILD
                                  (looking up)
                             Find out about that bullet yet?
    
                   Bob Yes, sir.  It's from the same gun that killed Julia 
                   Wolf.  There is a second of silence.  Guild and Nick look 
                   at each other.
    
                                         NICK
                             And how are your folks?
    
                   The telephone rings.  Guild picks it up.  His face beams.
    
                                         GUILD
                                  ((in phone)
                             How are you?  -- No, we didn't get 
                             a thing.
                                  (He hands the phone 
                                  to Nick)
                             It's your wife. 
    
                   Nick reaches for the phone, smiling.
    
                   CLOSEUP - NORA AT PHONE
    
                   She is in the Jorgensen apartment, but in a room by herself. 
                   She speaks softly.  She thinks she is still talking to 
                   Guild.
    
                                         NORA.
                             Well, I've got something, 
                             Lieutenant.  I've been doing a 
                             little detective work of my own.  
                             That flat foot I married thinks 
                             he's smart -- but I'm one jump 
                             ahead of him.
    
                                                                    BACK TO:
    
                   CLOSEUP ON NICK.
    
                   He plays straight in his best manner.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (kidding her)
                             Um?
    
                                         NORA'S VOICE
                                  (Through receiver)
                             Do you hear me?
    
                                         NICK)
                                  (grinning)
                             How's Grant's tomb?
    
                                                                    BACK TO:
    
                   CLOSEUP OF NORA -- PHONE.
    
                   She starts at this, recognizing Nick's voice.  Again she 
                   sticks up her nose, a little characteristic of hers in 
                   matters concerning Nickie.  Then she snaps:
    
                                         NORA
                             It's lovely.  I'm having a copy 
                             made for you --
    
                                                                    BACK TO:
    
                   CLOSE TWO SHOT - NICK AND GUILD.
    
                   Nick laughs, then -- seriously:
    
                                         NICK
                             What have you got?
    
                   Nora's voice comes through, but she is evidently speaking 
                   in a low whisper and the words are inaudible.
    
                                         NICK
                             Can't hear you -- little lou --
                                  (an alert look comes 
                                  into his eyes as 
                                  he listens closer, 
                                  getting what she 
                                  is saying.  Guild, 
                                  too, is interested.)
                             We'll be right up!
                                  (Nick puts down the 
                                  phone and turns to 
                                  Guild)
                             She's up at Mimi's.  Jorgensen has 
                             disappeared.
    
                   The two men rise.
    
                                                           FAST DISSOLVE TO:
    
                   CLOSEUP ON MIMI -- HER BEDROOM.
    
                   She is seated facing Nick in her bedroom, although in this 
                   opening dissolve we do not reveal him.  WE HOLD ON MIMI as 
                   she speaks hysterically.
    
                                         MIMI
                             Chris may be at the club -- or 
                             somewhere -- I don't see that it's 
                             important --
    
                                         NICK (O.S.)
                             You should have told them he'd 
                             disappeared.
    
                   CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL THE ROOM NOW as Mimi jumps up.  
                   Nick is seated, questioning her.  Dorothy hovers behind 
                   Nick.
    
                                         MIMI
                                  (her manner and 
                                  tone more distrait)
                             But he has nothing to do with it!
    
                                         NICK
                             That's not for you to decide. 
                             Everybody's under suspicion - 
                             especially running off like this --
                                  (he picks up a 
                                  picture of Jorgensen 
                                  from the bureau)
                             The police will want his 
                             description.  Is this a picture of 
                             him?
    
                   Mimi tries to take the picture.
    
                                         MIMI
                             I tell you -- he didn't do it.
    
                                         NICK
                             They'll want more than your word 
                             for that.
    
                                         MIMI
                                  (coming forward and 
                                  speaking slowly)
                             All right, then -- I'll tell them 
                             who did do it!
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (with horror in her 
                                  voice)
                             Mother!
    
                                         MIMI
                                  (paying no attention)
                             And I'll give then proof!
    
                   Dorothy turns and goes quickly from the room.
    
                   HALLWAY OF APARTMENT.
    
                   Dorothy comes out of the bedroom, blind with horror at 
                   what her Mother is doing.  For a minute she stands there, 
                   trying to collect herself.  Andy comes from the living 
                   room, where he has been waiting for her.  He goes to her 
                   and takes her in his arms. She looks up at him.
    
                                         ANDY
                                  (with tremendous 
                                  pity in his voice)
                             Dorry!
    
                   For a minute she clings to him, crying,
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             Oh, Andy.
    
                                         ANDY
                             Don't cry.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             I can't help it.  You don't 
                             know.....
    
                                         ANDY
                                  (protectively)
                             Darling, you can't go through any 
                             more of this.  Now you get together 
                             your clothes and your skates and 
                             we'll go out to my family's in the 
                             country.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (she stops crying)
                             I can't.
    
                                         ANDY
                             You've got to get your mind off 
                             this.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (she pulls herself 
                                  together)
                             You're sweet, but the only thing 
                             that you can do for me is to go.
    
                                         ANDY
                             Go!
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             And don't ever try to see me again.
    
                                         ANDY
                             What are you talking about?
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (with rising 
                                  excitement)
                             Please!  You can't get mixed up in 
                             this.
    
                                         ANDY
                             Do you think I care
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             You don't understand.  You don't 
                             know what's going to happen.
    
                                         ANDY
                             I only know I want to marry you... 
                             right now, and --
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             I can't marry you!  I can't ever 
                             marry you!
    
                                         ANDY
                             Dorothy!
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (hysterically)
                             How would you like to have a couple 
                             of little murderers for your 
                             children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't 
                             it?  Maybe they'd murder each 
                             other...  keep it all in the family.  
                             That's what Father should have 
                             done.  He should have killed me 
                             and Gilbert... then we wouldn't 
                             have had this to go through.
    
                                         ANDY
                             You're talking like a crazy person,
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             Why not? I am crazy....the whole 
                             family's crazy.
    
                                         ANDY
                             Dorothy.... listen to me. I love 
                             you.  Don't you understand that?  
                             I love you.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             Go away!
    
                                                                     CUT TO:
    
                   LIVING ROOM - SHOOTING TOWARD HALL.
    
                   Nora and Guild are waiting for Nick.  Gilbert is sitting 
                   with a large book open in his hand.  Dorothy's voice comes 
                   through.  The three in the living room cannot help but 
                   hear.
    
                                         DOROTHY'S VOICE (O.S.)
                             Go away!
    
                   A door slams.  Andy is seen walking slowly past the living 
                   room door, on his way out of the apartment.  Gilbert gets 
                   up and goes quickly out.  Nora looks at Guild and sighs.
    
                                         NORA
                             Sleuthing isn't all fun, is it?  I 
                             feel so sorry for that poor girl -
    
                   Nick comes in with the photograph of Jorgensen, which he 
                   has taken from the frame.
    
                                         GUILD
                             Get anything?
    
                                         NICK
                             She's ready to talk.
                                  (he hands Guild 
                                  Jorgensen's 
                                  photograph)
                             It won't do any harm, though - to 
                             find out where he is.
    
                                                                     CUT TO:
    
                   DOROTHY'S BEDROOM.
    
                   Dorothy is lying on the bed, face down.
    
                   Gilbert walks up to her, his big book still in his hand.
    
                                         GILBERT
                             You know, you're wrong about all 
                             of your children being murderers...  
                             I've studied the Mendelian Law of 
                             inheritance and their experiments 
                             with sweet peas, and according to 
                             their findings... and they've been 
                             pretty conclusive... only one out 
                             of four of your children will be a 
                             murderer.  So the thing for you to 
                             do would be to have just three 
                             children...
                                  (then as a thought 
                                  comes to him)
                             ... no, no.  That might not work  
                             The first one might be the bad 
                             one.  I'll have to look that up.
    
                   By this tine Dorothy gets up. She has a defiant look on 
                   her face.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             You needn't look it up.  I'm not 
                             going to get married and I'm not 
                             going to have any children.  From 
                             now on, I'm just out for the ride!
    
                                                                    BACK TO:
    
                   LIVING ROOM - MEDIUM ON GROUP.
    
                   Mimi is showing Guild the watch chain.  Nick is watching 
                   her closely. Nora is tense with interest.
    
                                         MIMI
                                  (her voice quivering 
                                  with forced emotion)
                             I took this from her hand.  It's 
                             Mr. Wynant's watch chain.
                                  (Guild takes it 
                                  from her)
                             I wanted to protect him.
    
                   She breaks into tears.  Nick looks over at her sardonically. 
                   Guild watches her with evident sympathy.  Guild gets up, 
                   putting the watch chain carefully in his handkerchief.

                             I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. 
                             Charles?  He killed them both - 
                             Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
    
                                         NICK

                             This is enough for me.

                   (b) GATE - GRAND CENTRAL STATION.
    
                   A policeman stands at the gate scanning the passengers as 
                   they go through. (Through this and ensuing vignettes, the 
                   dull voice of the Police Announcer continues over the 
                   flashes.  Entire effect designed to excitingly dramatize 
                   the spreading of the net for the capture of Clyde Wynant.)
    
                   (c) A PRINTING PRESS.
    
                   It is running off police placards announcing the reward 
                   for the capture of Clyde Wynant.
    
                   (d) TELETYPE MACHINE.
    
                   OVER THE MACHINE IS COMING:
    
                   "Wynant wanted -- watch all stations -- boats and roads -- 
                   description - thin man -- six feet -- white hair, etc.,

                   (e) NEWSPAPER TRUCK -- STREET CORNER.
    
                   Newsboys are crowded around the back of the truck.  A man 
                   is hurling packs of LATE EXTRAS down to the boys.  They 
                   immediately begin calling out:
    
                                         NEWSBOYS
                             "Extra -- extra -- Wynant wanted 
                             in second murder --"

                             charge against Wynant --"
    
                   Pictures of Wynant, most of them full length  (for the 
                   desired effect of the tall, thin man) cover the front pages.  
                   Second and third trucks can back into the scene, if desired.  
                   Necessary, dramatically, to kick up the idea that the chase 
                   for the killer is increasing to fever heat.
    
                                                                DISSOLVE TO:
    
                   CLOSE SHOT ON NORA - AT WINDOW.
    
                   She is at the window of their bedroom in the hotel Normandie 
                   again.  We process through the window to get a background 
                   of Central Park, South.  On SOUND TRACK from below we get 
                   a carry-over of the newsboys' "Extra!  Extra!" from 
                   preceding effects.  One shrill voice is heard in relief 
                   against the others.  It is shouting: "Extra -- extra -- 
                   police hunt Wynant --" Nora listens for a second and then 
                   shuts the window, turning away from it.
    
                                         NORA
                             I wish they'd stop that.  It makes 
                             me fidgety. Do you think they'll 
                             find him, Nick?  He must be in New 
                             York....
                                  (she stops short as 
                                  CAMERA PULLS BACK 
                                  and she sees Nick 
                                  is in his overcoat, 
                                  bending over Asta 
                                  with a leash)

                             He's just been for a walk.

                             we, Asta?
    
                   He starts to go -- but Nora puts a hand on a bulge in his 
                   overcoat pocket.

                                  in and pulls out a 
                                  bunch of skeleton

                                  out a pistol - she

                             Looks like a hold-up!

                             I've got hunch.  I'm going down to 
                             look at Wynant's shop, I want to 
                             find out why it's closed.
    
                                         NORA
                             Why shouldn't be close it? He went 
                             away.
    
                                         NICK
                             He went away lots of times when I 
                             knew him - but he never closed his 
                             shop. I've got a hunch something 
                             is up.
    
                                         NORA
                             You mean, he might be hiding there?

                             Nick - I won't have you going down

                             He's a crazy man. He might kill 
                             you.

                             I'll be all right.  I've got Asta 
                             to protect me.

                             But it's a dirty trick bringing me 
                             all the way to New York just to 
                             make me a widow.
    
                                         NICK
                             You wouldn't be a widow long.

                             Why, I believe the little woman 
                             cares.

                                  under a pretense 
                                  of clowning)
                             If you let anything happen to him, 
                             you'll never wag that tail again!

                   EXT. OF WYNANT'S SHOP - LIGHTING EFFECT
    
                   The street is deserted. The light from the street lamps is 
                   very dim.  A cab drives up before the shop.  The door of 
                   the cab opens and Asta jumps out, and makes a bee-line for 
                   a hydrant.  Nick follows him, still in his evening clothes.  
                   He turns to pay he driver, who is looking dubiously at the 
                   neighborhood.  Driver Sure this is the place you want?
    
                                         NICK
                             This is it.
    
                                         DRIVER
                                  (looking 
                                  apprehensively at 
                                  the street)
                             You don't want me to wait, do you?
    
                                         NICK
                             No thanks.
                                  (Nick pays him)
    
                                         DRIVER
                                  (with a last look, 
                                  he says dubiously)
                             Well .... good luck!
    
                   He drives off.  The street is quiet.  Nick turns toward 
                   the shop.  Nick stands for a second looking at the building, 
                   then turns to Asta.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (to Asta)
                             Ready?  Well, let's go.
    
                   He goes to the front door of the shop.  He tries it.  It 
                   is locked.  From his pocket he takes out a ring with 
                   skeleton keys on it.
    
                   Holding his flashlight on the key hole, he finally finds 
                   the key that opens it.  He pushes the door slowly open.  
                   He holds it open, looking back at Asta.
    
                                         NICK
                             You keep quiet now. Come on.
    
                   But Asta doesn't like the looks of the place. He doesn't 
                   move.  Nick snaps his fingers for him to come and Asta 
                   finally, reluctantly follows him.
    
                   INTERIOR BUILDING -- TRUCKING AND PANNING
    
                   On Nick as he makes his way down the narrow little hall, 
                   guided by his flashlight.  Asta trails, still reluctantly.  
                   Nick is familiar with the old building so that he does not 
                   lose time in reaching the rear, where he goes down the 
                   steps, cautiously, to the basement.
    
                   MACHINE SHOP AND STOREROOM IN BASEMENT - LONG SHOT
    
                   (This room leads to Wynant's private work-shop as 
                   established earlier.)
    
                   Nick moves stealthily through the storeroom, flashing his 
                   light here and there on crates, boxes of machinery, etc.  
                   It is a weird scene, at any moment you must feel that 
                   Wynant, or some foe will spring from behind the objects.  
                   (His figure is mostly in silhouette during, the scene.  He 
                   flashes his light in quick short flashes.)
    
                   Nick sees a moving shadow.  Asta starts to growl.  Nick 
                   whips out his gun.  Then throws the light of his flashlight 
                   onto a pile of
    
                   [NOTE: Sorry -- page missing. The "moving shadow" turns 
                   out to be a cat.]
    
                   nothing that will help him. He is starting out, when he 
                   misses Asta. He calls him softly. We hear the dog whine.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (to Asta)
                             Well, come along, then...
    
                   Still the dog does not come. We hear him whine again.  
                   Nick flashes his light around until it lights on the dog.  
                   Asta is in the center of the floor.  He has his ears back.  
                   He is sniffing at the floor. Nick keeping his flashlight 
                   on Asta, comes back.  He leans down to the floor, running 
                   his hand over the cement.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (softly)
                             You're not a Scottish Terrier.  
                             You're a police dog.  New cement.
    
                   He gets up briskly and looks around, using his flashlight, 
                   to find a tool.  He finds an iron bar.  Placing the light 
                   so that it falls on the floor.  Nick takes the iron bar.  
                   He pounds on the floor.  Over the place where Asta was 
                   whining, the cement gives out a hollow sound.  Nick takes 
                   the bar in both hands, throws his whole strength into it, 
                   trying to force it through the floor.  It finally goes 
                   through.  Nick leans down, and a startled, horrified look 
                   comes in his face.  He puts down the bar, picks up Asta, 
                   who is flattened on the floor, watching him, takes his 
                   flashlight and goes quickly toward the stairs.  He climbs 
                   rapidly.
    
                   CRANE SHOT -- FLIGHT OF STAIRS LEADING TO WYNANT'S OFFICE 
                   ON SECOND FLOOR.  (AS EARLIER ESTABLISHED.)
    
                   He uses his flashlight to find his way. The stairway, being 
                   as old as the building, CREAKS as he walks.  WE CONTINUE 
                   TO CRANE until he reaches the second floor and cautiously 
                   enters the old office.
    
                   WYNANT'S OFFICE - FULL SHOT.
    
                   All is pitch dark as he follows his flashlight to the 
                   telephone, dials the number, then extinguishes the light.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (in telephone)
                             Hello, Lieutenant Guild, please... 
                             John?  This is Charles.  I'm up in 
                             Wynant's shop.  Well, I've found 
                             something... it's a body.
    
                   He puts down the telephone.  Using his flashlight, he goes 
                   to the desk and begins to look through the papers there.
    
                   EFFECT SHOT -- CAMERA AT BOTTOM OF STAIRWAY, SHOOTING UP.
    
                   On the figure of a man as it is quietly going up the same 
                   stairway that Nick took, slowly going toward the office.  
                   He has no light, but by his unhesitating steps, we gather 
                   that he is familiar with the building. The steps creak a 
                   little.
    
                                                                    BACK TO:
    
                   WYNANT'S OFFICE  - CLOSE SHOT ON NICK.
    
                   He is still rummaging over the desk.  Suddenly he stands 
                   rigid.  He has heard a step.  He puts out his flashlight 
                   and whirls around to face the door.  At this instant, CAMERA 
                   SWINGS OVER TO:
    
                   THE DOOR
    
                   As the man's figure appears.  As he starts to come in, 
                   Nick's flashlight is thrown full on his face, blinding 
                   him.  We see that it is Tanner.
    
                                         NICK'S VOICE (O.S.)
                             Stick 'em up!
    
                   Tanner, terrified by the light and the sharp command from 
                   the darkness, puts up his hands.  Asta begins to bark.  
                   Keeping the light full on Tanner's face, Nick swiftly 
                   searches him.  Satisfied that Tanner has no gun, Nick goes 
                   to an electric light switch.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (as he does this)
                             Don't make a move or that dog will 
                             tear you to shreds!
    
                   He switches on the light.  Tanner looks in, blinking 
                   amazement and fear, first at Nick, and then at --
    
                   BIG CLOSEUP OF ASTA
    
                   He has crawled under the desk and lies there, looking out 
                   fearfully.
    
                                                                    BACK TO:
    
                   MEDIUM ON NICK AND TANNER
    
                   Nick grins a little at Asta's fear and Tanner's 
                   bewilderment.
    
                                         NICK
                             Come on out, now.  He won't hurt 
                             you.
                                  (then to Tanner, 
                                  with a return of 
                                  his brisk, 
                                  professional tone)
                             Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
    
                                         TANNER
                             No, Mr. Charles.
    
                                         NICK
                             How did you get in here?
    
                                         TANNER
                             I had a key. I worked here... till 
                             they closed the shop.

                             You worked here?
    
                                         TANNER
                             Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job 
                             as bookkeeper.

                             Well, that's a hot one.  You a 
                             bookkeeper!  When were you ever a 
                             bookkeeper?
    
                                         TANNER
                             That time you sent me up last ... 
                             I learned book-keeping at Sing 
                             Sing.  I figured it might be an in 
                             for me somewhere's.

                             out and leave the safe open?
    
                                         TANNER
                             Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never 
                             touched that safe.  Them bonds 
                             that were missing... Julia took 
                             them.

                             Mr. Charles - she did - that's why 
                             he got sore at her and killed her.  
                             Listen, Mr. Charles --
                                  (he pulls out some 
                                  bills)
                             I did do a little chiseling.  I 
                             come to bring it back and fix up 
                             the books.  I didn't want him to
                             find out and come after me -
    
                                         NICK
                             You can save that and tell it to 
                             the police.  They'll be here in a 
                             minute.
    
                                         TANNER
                                  (a hunted look comes 
                                  into his face)
                             Police!
    
                   He shrinks back, aghast, as at this moment we hear the 
                   sound of sirens from police cars arriving outside.  Asta 
                   crawls back under the desk.
    
                   EXTERIOR WYNANT'S SHOP - STREET - NIGHT.
    
                   There is a rising crescendo of sirens as Guild's police 
                   car, and the Medical Examiner's car swing around the corner, 
                   accompanied by a motorcycle escort.  They pull to a stop 
                   at the front of the shop.  The police and Dr.  Walton, 
                   with his assistant, get out of the cars and go to the door 
                   of the building.  There are police photographers with them.  
                   Nick, with Tanner in his custody, is waiting at the door 
                   of the shop.
    
                                                                DISSOLVE TO:
    
                   WYNANT'S SHOP - BASEMENT.
    
                   The floor is dug up more than in the last scene, so that 
                   the body is exposed enough for the photographers.  Guild, 
                   Nick, Dr. Walton, Tanner and the rest of the police stand 
                   aside as the photographers take their flashlight pictures 
                   from different angles.  Guild is putting on a pair of 
                   gloves.  Dr. Walton is preparing to do his work.  Nick, in 
                   his evening clothes and his casual air, is an incongruous 
                   note in the midst of all the professional excitement.  As 
                   the photographers finish, Guild steps up to the hole in 
                   the floor.  He turns to Tanner, who is watching, horrified.

                                         TANNER

                             see him later.
    
                   The policeman goes out with Tanner. Guild looks down into 
                   the hole.
    
                                         GUILD

                                  whistle)
                             I wonder what Wynant had against 
                             this one?  Quick lime. Well at 
                             least the clothes weren't touched.
    
                   The Medical Examiner comes up and stands beside him.

                             Go ahead.
    
                   Guild stoops down and takes out a bundle of clothes.  The 
                   CAMERA PANS with him as he takes them over to a work table 
                   and starts to open them up.  Nick strolls over and stands 
                   watching him.

                             Just rolled them up and threw them 
                             in.

                             Lucky thing for us they weren't in 
                             that lime.

                             Extraordinarily lucky.
    
                   Guild pulls a coat from the bundle.  It is a large coat, 
                   slightly eaten by the lime.  Guild picks it up and examines 
                   it for a tailor's label.

                             the scene.  He hands Guild a walking 
                             stick.  Guild takes it and examines 
                             it.

                             weight around.
    
                   Guild takes the trousers and stretches them out.

                             to the trousers -
    
                   Guild looks at it. He finds some initials engraved on the 
                   silver buckle.

                             Yes.  But we figured it was just 
                             blackmail...

                             I can't say offhand.  At least a 
                             couple of months...

                             when he closed the shop.  The way 
                             I figure it is... he kills this 
                             guy and plants him here.  Julia 
                             knows about it, so he kills her.  
                             And Nunheim caught him at that, so 
                             he he had to bump off Nunheim.

                   Nick walks over to the Medical Examiner who is putting on 
                   his coat, preparatory to going.  The Medical Examiner speaks 
                   to his assistant, indicating the wrapped up body, out of 
                   the scene.

                   By this time Guild is ready to go.  He turns to Nick, the 
                   bundle of clothes under his arm.

                   He turns to go out, almost bumping into a figure in the 
                   semi-darkness. It is apparently a slender boy, his coat 
                   collar high about his neck, and his hat pulled down over 
                   his eyes.  Nick spies him at the same time and comes toward 
                   him.  Guild speaks sharply to the boy.
    
                                         GUILD
                                  (to the boy)
                             What're you doing here?
    
                                         NICK
                                  (to Guild - knowing 
                                  who it is)
                             I'll take care of him.
    
                   Guild grunts and continues on his way.  Nick takes the boy 
                   by the arm, and unceremoniously hustles him out.  Nick has 
                   Asta under his other arm.
    
                                                                     CUT TO:
    
                   EXT. OF BUILDING
    
                   Nick hustles the boy into a taxicab, and follows him in, 
                   speaking to the driver as he gets in.
    
                                                                     CUT TO:
    
                   CLOSEUP OF NICK
    
                   Nick is seated in the cab.  He is looking with a 
                   disapproving scowl at his companion.
    
                                         NICK
                             What do you think you are?
    
                   The CAMERA PANS to his companion.  We see that it is Nora.  
                   She is dressed in Nick's clothes.  She has even used some 
                   of her hair to make a mustache.  She looks at Nick with a 
                   twinkle in her eye, and strokes the points of her mustache 
                   in imitation of him as she speaks.
    
                                         NORA
                             I'm a 'de-tect-uf'.
    
                                                                DISSOLVE TO:
    
                   CLOSEUP OF FLUOROSCOPE.  (Police Laboratory)
    
                   The light of the fluoroscope comes through the skeleton of 
                   the body.  The Medical Examiner's hand comes into the shot, 
                   pointing to a dark spot in the left side of the body, near 
                   the heart.
    
                                         DR. WALTON'S VOICE (O.S.)
                             There's the bullet he was killed 
                             with.  See?
    
                                         NICK'S VOICE (O.S.)
                             What's this?
    
                   His hand comes into the shot, pointing to a smaller speck 
                   in the shin bone.  THE CAMERA NOW PULLS back to show the 
                   two men in Dr.  Walton's laboratory looking at the body 
                   under the fluoroscope.  Dr. Walton looks closer.
    
                                         DR. WALTON
                             Oh, just an old piece of shrapnel.
    
                   An idea comes to Nick.  He is piecing things together in 
                   his mind.
    
                                         NICK
                             Shrapnel!
    
                                         DR. WALTON
                                  (still inspecting)
                             Must have been in the war.  That 
                             might account for the cane and his 
                             limp.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (thinking of 
                                  something else)
                             Yes... yes.
    
                   AS WE 
    
                                                                DISSOLVE TO:
    
                   SERIES OF EFFECT FLASHES -- THIRD MURDER --
    
                   POLICE DRAGNET
    
                   In terrific tempo, with the elongated shadow of the Thin 
                   Man behind the flashes, we bring in, kaleidoscopically, 
                   police teletypes -- radio broadcasts -- telephone and 
                   telegraph -- wireless -- radio cars, etc.  Chief among 
                   these effects are superimposed closeups of police and 
                   detective chiefs as they talk into phones, firing their 
                   orders.  By the nature of the uniforms worn by the police 
                   captains, we must achieve the idea that the man-hunt is 
                   NATION WIDE. 
    
                   Also SUPERIMPOSED are newspaper headlines, tabloids, etc.,
    
                   SCREAMING OUT:
    
                   "WYNANT HUNTED IN THIRD MURDER --" 
    
                   "WYNANT VICTIM BURIED IN BASEMENT --"
    
                   "HORROR MURDER LAID TO WYNANT --" 
    
                   "WYNANT BODY NUMBER THREE DUG UP IN CEMENT --" etc., etc. 
    
                   Also, on SOUND TRACK, through radio and telephone, we hear 
                   continuous voices as they report: "WYNANT SEEN HERE -- 
                   WYNANT SEEN THERE --" etc.
    
                   These are Vorkapich shots, and conclude with thrilling 
                   flashes of automobiles being stopped on roads by traffic 
                   officers, squad cars racing to and fro from headquarters, 
                   etc.
    
                                                                DISSOLVE TO:
    
                   CLOSEUP OF ASTA.
    
                   The dog is standing on a table. The CAMERA PULLS BACK to 
                   show the living room of Nick's suite.  The reporters are 
                   on Nick's trail again.  The floor is littered with 
                   newspapers.
    
                   Nora, in negligee, is being interviewed by a 'sob sister'.  
                   Nick is near the table where the drinks are surrounded by 
                   reporters.
    
                   A newspaper photographer is taking Asta's picture as he 
                   stands on the table.

                                  down near the floor)
                             Hey... doggie, doggie.  Look down 
                             at the body!
                             Look down at the body!
                                  (Asta looks down at 
                                  the man's hand and

                                  flares up. The 
                                  photographer 
                                  hurriedly goes to 
                                  Nick)

                             Just one family group.
                             Sob Sister It'd be lovely for the 
                             woman's page.
    
                   Nick goes to stand beside Nora, and the photographer puts 
                   Asta in Nora's arms. The reporters follow Nick, asking him 
                   questions.
    
                                         1ST REPORTER
                             Have the police got any idea where 
                             Wynant is?
    
                                         NICK
                             No.

                             I know they will.
    
                   The flashlights flare again.  Nick moves away.

                             Got anything else to say about the 
                             case?
    
                                         NICK
                             Yes.  It's put me way behind in my 
                             drinking.
    
                   He starts for the table where the liquor is.
    
                                         1ST REPORTER

                                  (to Nick)
                             Thanks, Nick.
    
                   The reporters all start for the door.

                             Right back to California.  We've 
                             got to go home and rest up from

                   They all go out.  CAMERA MOVES IN FOR CLOSE PANNING SHOT.

                             It was his body that was buried 
                             there.
    
                                         NORA
                             Nick, you'd better lay off that 
                             liquor.
    
                                         NICK
                             That's a fact.

                             Yup.  Don't you want something to

                                  (he indicates the 
                                  detective)
                             ...give you my invitation?
    
                                         QUINN
                             You can't get away with this.
    
                   The detective is closing in on him.
    
                                         NICK
                             You're perfectly right.

                             Take the gentleman's coat and bag.
    
                   The detective starts, not too gently to take Quinn's coat 
                   from him.
    
                   CLOSE SHOT - DOROTHY AND ANDY
    
                   Dorothy takes a drink from the waiter.  Andy starts toward 
                   her.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                                  (to Andy)
                             This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't 
                             it?
    
                                         ANDY
                             You're high enough.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             Why not?
    
                   Nick comes up to her.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             You know, you interrupted me at a 
                             very important point in my life.  
                             I was about to take my first false 
                             step.
                                  (calling to Quinn)
                             Come on, Quinny. Let's dance -
    
                   She walks away from Andy and Nick.
    
                                         ANDY
                                  (to Nick)
                             I'm getting out of here.
    
                                         NICK
                             No - I need you here.
    
                                         ANDY
                                  (glowering at Quinn)
                             If I stay, I know I'll take a poke 
                             at him.
    
                                         NICK
                             Then I insist that you stay.
    
                                                                     CUT TO:

                             I want some more of that tiger 
                             milk.
    
                   She starts off to get another drink.  Morelli looks after 
                   her admiringly.
    
                                         MORELLI
                                  (to Guild)
                             I think somebody could do something 
                             with that girl if they took hold 
                             of her right.

                             Yeah - by the throat!
    
                                                                     CUT TO:
    
                   MEDIUM SHOT NEAR TABLE.
    
                   Nora is near the dinner table with Guild beside her.  
                   Marian, Macaulay, Mimi, Gilbert, Tanner and Morelli are 
                   nearby.
    
                                         NORA
                             I think we may as well sit down.

                                  (looking around)
                             I guess all the suspects are here.
    
                   There is a second of stunned amazement on the people's 
                   faces.
    
                                         NORA
                             Mr. Guild means guests!
                                  (counting noses)
                             Oh, there are two more to come.
    
                                         GUILD
                             They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My 
                             men are picking them up.
    
                                         NORA
                                  (beaming at him)
                             You're a great help to a hostess.  
                             I wish I always had you for my 
                             dinner parties.
    
                   Nora starts to seat the guests.
    
                                         MIMI
                                  (looking toward the 
                                  door)
                             Chris!
    
                   She walks rapidly out of the scene, and
    
                   WE PAN WITH HER TO THE:
    
                   DOORWAY.
    
                   Jorgensen and a woman have come in the door.  She is a 
                   hard-faced, common woman, who looks as if she could handle 
                   any situation.  They are standing there angry and 
                   belligerent.  There are a couple or plain-clothes men with 
                   them.
    
                                         NICK
                             I'm Nick Charles. How do you do?
    
                   Mimi rushes up to Jorgensen.
    
                                         MIMI
                             Chris, where have you been?
    
                   She stops as she sees the other woman.  One of the plain-
                   clothesmen speaks to Nick.
    
                                         PLAIN-CLOTHESMAN
                             Sorry we're late.  But they had to 
                             break down the door.
    
                   Mimi bristles at this.  She gives the woman a withering 
                   look and walks out of the scene. Nick watches with great 
                   amusement.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (to Jorgensen and 
                                  the woman)
                             Won't you come in?
    
                   The two reluctantly follow him further into the room.  
                   Nick follows them, rubbing his hands with delighted 
                   anticipation of the scene to follow.  The CAMERA PANS WITH 
                   HIM as goes to the table.  The people are all seated with 
                   the exception of Mimi, Jorgensen and the woman with him, 
                   and Nick.  Nora is watching the new arrivals with eager 
                   interest.  Nick looks at her and gives her a broad wink.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (turning to Jorgensen)
                             Mr. Jorgensen, you sit next to 
                             Andrew, and Mrs.  Jorgensen on 
                             your right.
    
                   Both Mimi and the woman who came in with Jorgensen, start 
                   for the chair which Jorgensen is holding.  As they find 
                   themselves both going for the same chair, Mimi draws herself 
                   up with great dignity.
    
                                         MIMI
                             I'm Mrs. Jorgensen.
    
                   Mimi starts to sit.
    
                                         THE WOMAN
                                  (drily, as she points 
                                  to an empty chair 
                                  across the table)
                             Put it over there.  I was Mrs. 
                             Jorgensen before you were.
    
                   Mimi looks at Jorgensen, bewildered.  But he refuses to 
                   meet her eye.  The other woman sits down firmly in the 
                   chair.  Nick, from the head of the table, calls to Mimi.
    
                                         NICK
                             Mimi.... you're here on my right.
    
                   He holds her chair for her as she comes and sits down.  
                   The waiters start in immediately to serve dinner.
    
                                                                     CUT TO:

                   Nick holds Nora's chair for her.
    
                                         NORA
                             You give such charming parties,

                   Nora sits - she whispers to Nick.
    
                                         NORA
                             I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, 
                             do you think one of them did it?
    
                                         NICK
                             Yes.

                   Nick sits down at the head of the table.
    
                                                                     CUT TO:

                             This is all very pleasant but why 
                             are here?

                   They all turn and look at him with curiosity.  Guild looks 
                   amazed. Mimi is very composed.

                   Nick and Nora exchange looks.  Nora is bewildered.
    
                                         NICK
                             You did... where?

                             He didn't say very much.  Wanted 
                             to know how I was and how the 
                             children were.

                             he found out that Julia was cheating 
                             him, and was splitting with some

                   man, spills his soup over everything.  Everybody turns and 
                   looks suspiciously at him. Nick sees that he has startled

                             But I thought if we all had a little 
                             get-together we might be able to 
                             find out.  I'll tell you as much

                             This murderer is a very clever.

                             carefully.  You'd understand that,

                             He planned the whole thing 
                             beautifully. After he killed Wynant 
                             he wired Macaulay, using Wynant's 
                             name and told him to shut up the 
                             shop.  He destroyed all of Wynant's 
                             clothes, with the exception of his 
                             watch chain.  He figured that some 
                             day that might come in handy.  
                             Then he took Wynant's body and 
                             buried it in the shop with another 
                             man's clothes to throw us off the 
                             track.  He even put a belt buckle 
                             with an "R" on it, hoping that 
                             we'd think it was Rosebreen -- an 
                             old enemy of Wynant's who dropped 
                             out of sight years ago.

                             After our hero had killed Wynant, 
                             he got a brilliant idea.  He 
                             realized that he and Julia could 
                             still collect money.  Wynant was 
                             supposed to be on a trip - no one 
                             knew where - so our dinner guest 
                             wrote letters to Macaulay, signing 
                             Wynant's name, so that Macaulay 
                             would continue to send the money
                             to Julia.  He even telephoned 
                             Macaulay --
                                  (to Macaulay)
                             Do you remember?.... the first day 
                             that you came to see me... he 
                             telephoned that he was in town?

                             But it must have been Wynant.  I 
                             should have known if it weren't 
                             his voice.

                             Oh he as clever about that.  He 
                             called when you were out.  That 
                             same afternoon, Julia telephoned 
                             to him. She said that you were 
                             coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant.  
                             He got terrified. He was afraid 
                             that Julia would break down and 
                             tell... so he went to Julia and 
                             killed her and left Wynant's watch 
                             chain in her hand.

                             beautifully. Wynant was established 
                             as being in town.  The watch chain 
                             was handed over....

                             something.  Our hero paid Nunheim 
                             once to keep his mouth shut, and 
                             when Nunheim threatened him again, 
                             he bumped him off.

                             But our hero had just one weak 
                             link in his chain.  The telegrams, 
                             wires and telephones were all very 
                             well - but no one had seen Wynant.  
                             So he picked on poor Mimi here to 
                             strengthen his case.  Mimi is the 
                             only one at the table who can tell

                             you haven't re-married.  You're 
                             still one of the heirs.  What are 
                             you holding out for?  A few crummy 
                             dollars that that man gave you 
                             when you can get the whole estate?  
                             Remember the other two who were in 
                             with him on this... Julia and 
                             Nunheim.  When he thought they 
                             might spill something he bumped 
                             them off.  You ought to know damn 
                             well that he's not going to take 
                             any chances on you. What do you 
                             want to do?  Be next on his list?
    
                                         MIMI
                                  (Furious - to 
                                  Macaulay)
                             You dirty son of a b----- !
    
                   A crash of china drowns out the end of her speech as 
                   Macaulay rises to his feet.  Nick is on his feet in a 
                   minute.  He knocks Macaulay out.  Guild rises and stands 
                   looking down in stunned amazement at Macaulay. Nora and 
                   all the others leap up in amazement as the murderer is 
                   revealed.
    
                                         NICK
                             What do you want me to do?  Wrap 
                             him in cellophane?
    
                                                                  FAST FADE:
    
                   FADE IN:
    
                   CLOSE UP - FOUR CHAMPAGNE GLASSES
    
                   A small traveling Victrola is playing a gay tune.  The 
                   glasses are held up by four hands.
    
                   WE DISSOLVE THROUGH them to show the drawing room of a 
                   train.  Dorothy and Nora are sitting facing each other, 
                   dressed in robes and lounging pajamas, and Andy and Nick 
                   are sitting beside them, also in robes and pajamas.  Nick 
                   is pouring champagne from a bottle into the four glasses.  
                   The drawing room is full of flowers.  Nick puts down the 
                   bottle and holds up his glass in a toast.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (speaking)
                             To you two.
    
                                         ANDY
                             And to you two too.
    
                   OVER THE SOUND TRACK we hear the train whistle go "Toot-
                   toot" at a crossing.  The four raise their glasses in a 
                   toast and drink.  There is a buzz at the door.
    
                                         ANDY
                             Come!
    
                   A good-natured colored porter sticks his head in the door 
                   and speaks to Nick.
    
                                         PORTER
                             Your room's ready, sir.
    
                                         NICK
                             Thanks.  You can take Asta now.
    
                   Nora goes to where Asta is lying asleep.  She picks him 
                   up.
    
                                         NORA
                                  (to Asta)
                             You're going to your nice little 
                             bed in the baggage car.
    
                   She hands the dog to the porter.  As the porter is starting 
                   out, he sees Dorothy's bridal bouquet in the bracket in 
                   the corner of the drawing room.
    
                                         PORTER
                                  (to Dorothy, pointing 
                                  to the bridal 
                                  bouquet)
                             Shall I keep them fresh for you?
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             Please, if you will.
    
                   The porter takes the flowers and Asta and goes out.  There 
                   is a pause.  Simultaneously, Andy and Nick sneak a look at 
                   the wrist watches.  Andy looks up and catches Nick looking 
                   at his.  Nick is embarrassed but determined to call Nora's 
                   attention to the late hour.
    
                                         NICK
                             Might as well set it ahead now.
    
                   Nick starts to set his watch.  Nora leans over, is startled 
                   to see how late it is.
    
                                         NORA
                             Gracious!  One o'clock.  We'd better 
                             go.
    
                   She leans over Dorothy and kisses her affectionately.
    
                                         NORA
                             Good night.
    
                   Dorothy clings to Nora for a minute.
    
                                         DOROTHY
                             I can never thank you enough for 
                             all you've done.
    
                                         NORA
                                  (affectionately)
                             Forget it.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (to Andy and Dorothy)
                             Goodnight.  Goodnight.
    
                   There are mingled "good nights" as Nick and Nora go out 
                   the door.  As soon as the door closes, Andy takes Dorothy 
                   in his arms.
    
                                         ANDY
                                  (smiling -- shy)
                             I thought they'd never leave.
    
                   He kisses Dorothy affectionately.
    
                                                                     CUT TO:
    
                   NICK AND NORA'S DRAWING ROOM.
    
                   Nick is closing the door of their room.  As soon as it 
                   snaps shut.... they are in each other's arms.
    
                                         NICK
                                  (smiling... but not 
                                  shy)
                             I thought you'd never leave.
    
                   They kiss.
    
                                                                     CUT TO:
    
                   BAGGAGE CAR -- PANNING ON PORTER.
    
                   As he enters, Asta on one arm, flowers in the other.  He 
                   is about to put Asta down on the blanket for the night 
                   when he stops -- looks o.s.  CAMERA PANS OVER to show 
                   another dog of the same breed as Asta in a small crate.  
                   The dog is looking up at Asta eagerly.  And Asta's ears go 
                   up and his tail begins to wag as he anticipates the 
                   possibilities of a transcontinental romance.
    
                                         PORTER
                                  (getting it)
                             Asta -- meet Fifi --
    
                   And he puts Asta into the crate with Fifi .... places the 
                   BRIDAL BOUQUET on top of the crate ... turns and shuffles 
                   out as we are --
    
                                                                 FADING OUT:
    
                                            THE END
