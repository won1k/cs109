         FADE IN:
    
         EXT.  SKYLINE -- NIGHT
    
         Drizzling ... cold ... foggy ... gray sky vanishes into gray
         sea without a seam ... fog so dense we move through it
         blindly until ... looming huge:  the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE.
    
                SUPERIMPOSE:  SAN FRANCISCO -- THE NEAR FUTURE
    
         Impossibly close, we soar through repair scaffolding and
         over suspension wires ... glimpsing earthquake damage:
         broken concrete, dangling cables, cracked support beams.
    
         Turning south ... the familiar jewel-like cityscape  ... 
         Fisherman's Wharf ... Russian Hill ... yet there are now two
         Transamerica Towers and we CLIMB UP the new one.
    
         Reaching the fogless PINNACLE ... peace reigns ... as we float
         right through an ACCESS PANEL -- strangely wedged open -- and
    
         INTO THE TRANSAMERICA-TWO SPIRE
    
         A maze of wiring, ducts and maintenance-controls ... but behind
         one DUCT -- something HIDES ... something GLOWING RED  ... 
    
         TELESCOPE IN and find THE DEVICE.  Unlike any other explosive
         charge, it is complex in form and compact in size, with a
         sectioned, multi-colored cube panel and a glass GLOBE core  ... 
    
         MAGNIFY ... now we're INSIDE the globe ... in a gaseous soup  ... 
         with a zillion microscopic parasites ... they crowd the
         screen ... throbbing ... BUZZING like a swarm of angry wasps.
    
    
         INT.  TRANSAMERICA-TWO -- PARKING LEVEL LOBBY -- NIGHT
    
         Late.  The last few workoholics head for their cars.  The
         only sound is the sloshing of the Chinese JANITOR mopping.
    
         Slosh.  Slosh ... the FREIGHT ELEVATOR opens and out comes
         GEOFFREY BARNES (30).  Rumpled and out-of-breath -- the slim
         Englishman bumbles into the Janitor -- knocking him down.
    
                                  GEOFFREY
                        Thank goodness, a human being.
    
         Fumbling with his briefcase, he kicks over the pail.  Water
         sloshes everywhere.  The janitor starts yelling in CHINESE.
         Barnes replies -- in perfect Mandarin.
    
                                  GEOFFREY (cont'd)
                        [I'm terribly sorry, but
                        I feel like Icarus in the
                        labyrinth.  Where the devil
                        is Parking Level Red-14B?]
    
         The Janitor stares, then smiles and gives directions in
         Chinese.  BARNES graciously bows.  The Janitor bows back.
    
    
         INT./EXT.  STREETS -- SQUAD CAR -- NIGHT
    
         Cops MORRIS and HODGES wait for a green light at the
         intersection of Van Ness and Lombard.  The RADIO crackles on.
    
                                  DISPATCHER
                        Attention all units -- 211 at
                        Pier 39.  Suspect is a white male,
                        30's, 6 feet with specs, armed
                        and very dangerous.  Heading
                        south on Van Ness in a blue Ford
                        sedan.  Watch for this one,
                        fellas -- he's looney toons.
    
         The exchange glances as ... a blue FORD SEDAN motors by.
    
    
         INT.  CAR -- MOVING -- NIGHT
    
         Geoffrey Barnes innocently drives his rental car -- a blue
         Ford Sedan.  Tired, he stretches his long legs.
    
                                  GEOFFREY
                        Another day, another - cop?
    
         POLICE SIRENS blaze behind him.  Concerned and annoyed --
         Barnes finally pulls over.
    
         Adjusting his specs -- Barnes fumbles to find the car
         registration.  He turns -- and sees a POLICE AUTOMATIC
         pointing at his head.  Morris waves him out of the car.
    
    
         EXT.  FILLMORE PRECINCT -- NIGHT
    
         A modern multi-use high-rise.  A window-washing "DRONE"
         works its way up a grid-track.  As the RAIN increases, the
         drone stops cleaning and retracts into a maintenance shaft.
    
    
         INT.  PLEXIGLASS ELEVATOR -- MOVING -- NIGHT
    
         The elevator ascends quickly -- glimpsing floors dedicated
         to Evidence, Parking Authority, Civil Code, Small Claims,
         Identification etc.  A manacled Barnes trembles.
    
                                  GEOFFREY
                        You're making a ghastly
                        mistake!  I haven't been
                        to Fisherman's Wharf,  I
                        don't even like fish.
    
         Yeah, yeah, yeah -- like Hodges and Morris really care.
    
    
         INT.  BOOKING LEVEL -- NIGHT
    
         A busy night processing hookers, homeless and alcoholics.
         In the thick of it -- the BOOKING CLERK tries to lock Barnes's
         hand onto a PRINT-SCANNER -- but he resists mightily.
    
                                  GEOFFREY
                        Check my papers -- I'm with
                        the English consulate -- I've
                        got diplomatic immunity -- and
                        you've - got - no - right!
    
         Barnes pulls away, eyes flashing angrily ... until a HUGE
         COP grabs his hand and gently eases it down on the scanner.
    
    
         INT.  HOLDING TANK -- NIGHT
    
         Barnes's thrown into a cell with a nasty group of drunken
         GANG-BANGERS.  He smiles nervously, goes to the payphone.
    
         One WIRY HOOD trips him.  They laugh as Barnes struggles up,
         then inserts a "smart" card in the payphone slot.
    
                                  GEOFFREY
                        Hello!  Sorry I'm late, but
                        there's been a bit of a
                        muddle.  I'm on the ninth floor
                        of the bloody Fillmore police
                        station.  Could you come and
                        "bail me out" or whatever they
                        call it?  There's a good chap.
    
         He hangs up and glances at the threatening men.  The WIRY
         HOOD takes Barnes's glasses and snaps them in two.
    
    
         INT.  BAY VIEW HOTEL -- LOBBY -- NIGHT
    
         Rain-soaked, POLLUX TROY (30's) anxiously checks in.  He's a
         human hummingbird -- skittish, edgy, a bit paranoid.
    
                                  CLERK
                        -- I do have something on
                        the 26th floor facing west
                        -- but there's no view.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        Yes -- there is.
    
         POLLUX grabs the key and heads for the ELEVATOR.  He holds
         the elevator door open, waiting on a pair of muscular,
         crystal-eyed twins -- LARS and LUNT MUELLER.
    
         A helpful Bellhop reaches for Lars's large DUFFLE bag --
         Lars yanks it back and disappears into the elevator.
    
    
         INT.  IDENTIFICATION FLOOR -- ANALYSIS ROOM -- SAME TIME
    
         Chief analyst BRYCE shows a new TRAINEE the ropes.  He grabs
         a booking PRINT-OUT from a vacuum feeder tube:  Barnes's.
    
                                  BRYCE
                        If this guy took a shit off
                        the London Bridge -- we'll
                        know about it in two seconds.
    
         Bryce feeds the computer which WHIRS into action -- scanning
         the handprint.  The Trainee considers Barnes's innocently
         GOOFY MUGSHOT.
    
                                  TRAINEE
                        This guy?  I bet he never
                        even said the word shit.
    
         FULL SCREEN -- MONITOR
    
         BARNES'S prints match the record of one CASTOR TROY:
    
         WANTED -- PACIFIC STOCK EXCHANGE BOMBINGS, 12 DEAD
         WANTED -- ASSASSINATION OF CROATIAN AMBASSADOR
         WANTED -- KIDNAPPING OF BRUNEI CROWN PRINCE
    
         BRYCE and the TRAINEE look at each other -- stunned.
    
         But the FELONY LIST goes on ... MURDER ... ARSON ...
         KIDNAPPING ... TERRORISM ... with CD-ROM IMAGES of the
         crimes.  Finally ... at the bottom:
    
         IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON THE WHEREABOUTS OF THIS
         PERSON CALL CMD. JON ARCHER, NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY,
         WEST COAST DIVISION, IMMEDIATELY.
    
    
         INT.  PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
    
         Some office.  There's a stunning 180-view of TOWERING
         REDWOODS, a creek, even some ambling deer.  DR. RACHEL
         GARDNER (55) considers her fidgeting patient -- JON ARCHER.
    
         Archer's around 30, decent-looking, maybe even handsome if
         he ever smiled.  His eyes reveal a broken soul, a soul
         driven into the grip of obsession.
    
                                  DR. GARDNER
                        How is the "date night" idea
                        going over with Eve?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Like gangbusters, doc.
                            (off her look)
                        Okay, I missed the last one.
    
                                  DR. GARDNER
                        You missed the last three,
                        including her birthday.
                            (holds up a list)
                        Your wife's gripe sheet.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        I've been working night and
                        day.  I haven't had time.
    
                                  DR. GARDNER
                        You're supposed to make time.
                        When was the last time you
                        told her you love her?
                            (Archer shrugs)
                        When was the last time
                        you two had sex?
    
         Archer tightens up, says nothing.  He goes to the bookshelf,
         pushing IN a copy of "John Muir's Woods" -- and pulling OUT
         Dashiell Hammett's "Maltese Falcon".
    
         The redwood forest disappears from the "window".  A B&W;
         action-view of the streets of old San Francisco replaces it.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        One of my informants spotted
                        him -- right here in the city.
    
                                  DR. GARDNER
                        I just asked you about making
                        love to your wife, and you
                        started talking about your job.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        I'm not hiding in my work,
                        if that's what you're saying.
    
                                  DR. GARDNER
                        You said it, Jon, not me.
    
         Archer listens ... letting it sink in ... CONSIDERING.
    
                                  DR. GARDNER (cont'd)
                        You put yourself in constant
                        jeopardy so you don't have to
                        face yourself.  But what will you
                        do when the job is over -- and
                        there's no place left to hide?
    
         The phone RINGS.  Gardner picks it up, listens, then sighs.
    
                                  DR. GARDNER (cont'd)
                        I am not your secretary.
                        When you're in here --
    
                                  ARCHER
                            (grabs phone)
                        Jon Archer.
    
         As he listens, his face becomes more energized, more alive.
    
                                  ARCHER (cont'd)
                        I'll be right there,
                        Sergeant.  Don't talk to
                        him, don't listen to him,
                        and for God's sake --
                        don't go near him ...
    
    
         INT.  HOLDING TANK -- NIGHT
    
         Barnes signals Officer Morris, who is petting "Dinah," the
         precinct's mascot CAT.
    
                                  GEOFFREY
                        Excuse me, Officer.  May I
                        have a private word with you?
                            (Morris puts Dinah
                             down and approaches)
                        I just wanted to say ...
                            (drops English accent
                             and speaks in his
                             natural American idiom)
                        Thanks for being one dumb fuck.
    
         Barnes reaches through the bars, and SNAPS MORRIS'S NECK!
         Morris sags lifeless as "Barnes" -- aka CASTOR TROY --
         quickly and calmly grabs the unarmed cop's keys.
    
         Transformed, this man is coordinated, aggressive, sexy.
    
    
         INT.  HOTEL -- NIGHT
    
         Pollux and the twins hurry inside.  The door cracks open
         again as a hand hangs a DO NOT DISTURB card over the knob.
    
    
         EXT.  HOTEL ROOM -- SAME TIME
    
         This room does indeed have a view -- of the precinct's SQUAD
         ROOM -- through its steel-reinforced plexiglass windows.
    
         The trio scan with INFRA-RED GOGGLES:  HEAT SIGNATURES of
         computers, coffee makers, the cat -- finally a bald COP.
    
                                  LUNT
                        Number 6 -- the cue-ball.
    
         LARS sights through his laser-sighted RIFLE.  A harmless
         SPOT of light momentarily tags the cop's bald pate, then
         vanishes.  An LED on the rifle's scope clicks from 5 to 6.
    
                                  LARS
                        6 is tagged.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        Hurry ...
    
    
         INT.  PRECINCT -- NIGHT
    
         CASTOR picks his way through the back rooms of the precinct
         when a DOOR opens in front of him.
    
         A COP emerges from the head, zipping up his pants.  CASTOR
         silences the cop with a quick punch to the throat and drags
         him back into the head just before --
    
         BRYCE and cops charge by -- toward the holding tank.
    
         CASTOR slips out after they've passed.  Keeps moving.
    
    
         INT.  HOTEL -- NIGHT
    
         POLLUX aims, fires a SILENCED five-barrelled weapon --
    
    
         EXT.  PRECINCT WINDOWS -- NIGHT
    
         Five CHARGES sink into the reinforced plexiglass.
    
    
         INT.  HOTEL -- NIGHT
    
         POLLUX turns to the twins -- they nod.  Ready.
    
    
         INT.  PRECINCT -- NIGHT
    
         HOLDING ROOM:  BRYCE finds Morris dead, Castor gone.  He
         hits a button.
    
         SQUAD ROOM:  Busy Cops look up as the ALARM suddenly
         screams.  Then -- BOOM!  The plexiglass windows EXPLODE
         inward, leaving an enormous gash open to the whipping rain.
    
         INTERCUT:
    
         CASTOR emerges -- races for the gap -- as the COPS swiftly
         recover from the blast.  They grab their weapons and home in
         on Castor.  They move in fast -- and he's exposed as ...
    
         LARS raises the laser-sighted rifle and FIRES.
    
         A SWARM OF TRACER BULLETS roars toward the cops.  Spiralling
         and twisting, the armada of smart bullets SPLITS UP AND SEARCHES
         OUT their marked targets.  Just as Castor's surrounded ...
    
         A DOZEN COPS are cut down at once.  INSTANT SILENCE.
    
         A SILHOUETTE appears among the dead cops.
    
         LARS aims the rifle again, but Pollux stops him.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        It's my brother ...
    
         Indeed, the SILHOUETTE IS CASTOR.  He grabs a pistol, stuffs
         it in his belt and hurries to the edge.
    
         POLLUX fires a piton.  It sinks into the precinct wall at an
         incline, fixing a STEEL CABLE between the buildings.  Pollux
         nods "scram" to the TWINS who grab their bags and exit.
    
         CASTOR and POLLUX make eye-contact -- a silent communication
         -- as CASTOR secures himself on an inverted T-Grip pulley
         and starts slowly sliding along the rain-slicked cable.
    
    
         EXT.  HOTEL -- NIGHT
    
         CASTOR is halfway across when -- GUNSHOTS.  One grazes him,
         the other cracks the pulley.  It GRINDS to a halt.
    
         BRYCE -- wounded -- shakily aims from the wrecked precinct,
         about to fire again.  Pollux can't get a clear shot.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        Castor -- !
    
         Hanging from one hand, CASTOR blasts back -- nailing BRYCE.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Go on -- GO!
    
         Abandoning the broken pulley, CASTOR keeps moving -- hand-
         over-hand.  POLLUX hesitates -- then takes off.
    
    
         EXT.  HOTEL ENTRANCE -- NIGHT
    
         A black van screeches to a stop.  ARCHER steps out, followed
         by veteran TITO BIONDI and rookie LOOMIS.  Shattered GLASS
         crunches beneath Archer's shoes.
    
         HIGH ABOVE
    
         CASTOR'S GRIP starts to slip.  Struggling to hold on, he
         drops his pistol.  It falls -- TUMBLING -- as --
    
         STREET BELOW
    
         ARCHER looks up -- and catches the PISTOL.
    
         EYE-CONTACT between Archer and Castor.  Years of hatred pass
         between them.  Before Archer can open fire --
    
         A RANGE ROVER roars toward him -- POLLUX shoots as he drives
         right at the agents.
    
         ARCHER and team returns fire.  Wounded, LOOMIS goes down.
    
         Shredded, the RANGE ROVER spins out and FLIPS.
    
    
         INT.  HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
    
         CASTOR glances at the SWARM of authorities below.  He hauls
         himself INSIDE the room and sees that Pollux has left him an
         automatic pistol and a steaming cappuccino.
    
    
         INT./EXT.  RANGE ROVER -- STREET -- NIGHT
    
         Before bloody Pollux can come to his senses, ARCHER cuffs
         him to the steering wheel.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        You won't be using this
                        trick on me again.
    
         He reaches into Pollux's shirt and yanks off a chain from
         which hangs a tiny HANDCUFF KEY.  Pollux flails helplessly.
    
         Tito looks up from aiding Loomis -- whose ear is shredded
         -- to see Archer disappear into the hotel.
    
    
         INT.  HOTEL -- 26TH FLOOR -- NIGHT
    
         Gun ready, ARCHER emerges from the elevator.  He scopes out
         the cordite-reeking hotel corridor -- it's empty.
    
         Likewise the hotel room ... just an empty coffee cup.
    
    
         EXT.  ROOF -- NIGHT
    
         CASTOR skirts the rooftop dominated by an enormous NEON
         hotel sign, searching for a way out.
    
         He finds a hatch, set flush on the rooftop.  He grabs the
         handle, but it doesn't give.
    
         Setting down his pistol, he grasps the hatch handle with
         both hands and tugs hard.
    
         The flashing NEON strobes CASTOR'S SHADOW on a tank beneath
         the helipad -- marked "COOLANT UNDER PRESSURE -- NO SMOKING."
    
         As Castor works, a SECOND SHADOW melts into his.  For a
         moment the two shadows MERGE.  Then ...
    
                                  ARCHER (o.s.)
                        Turn around.
    
         CASTOR sees ARCHER standing behind him.  Gun trained.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Jon, I'm getting a little
                        annoyed by your obsessive
                        need to spoil my fun.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        And how much will your
                        "fun" net you this time?
    
         CASTOR plays for time -- inching toward his pistol.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        What's it to you?  I
                        declare it.  Here I am,
                        back in the States for
                        less than a month --
    
                                  ARCHER
                        You're under arrest.
                        Incredibly, you still have
                        the right to remain silent --
    
                                  CASTOR
                        What're you gonna do with
                        me gone?  You'll drive
                        your wife and kid nuts!
                        I bet your daughter is
                        just about ripe by now.
                        What's her name, Janie?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Mention my family once
                        more and you're dead.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        You can't kill me, Jon.
                        I've got something going
                        this Saturday night ...
                        it's gonna be worse than
                        anything God ever dumped
                        on the Pharaohs -- and
                        only I can stop it.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        You can tell me all about
                        it -- from your prison cell.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Don't count on it.
    
         CASTOR grabs for his gun.  ARCHER dives away, firing, as --
    
         Castor's shot rips into the COOLANT TANK.  WHOOSH!  The
         coolant sprays out -- blasting full-force at Castor.  He's
         thrown back and --
    
         CASTOR hits the neon sign.  Tangled in the shattered sign,
         rain-soaked CASTOR is ELECTROCUTED by a web of shorting wires.
    
         ARCHER stumbles away from the torrent of sparks and madly-
         whipping electrified wires.  He backs into --
    
                                  TITO
                        Tell me he didn't get
                        away again ...
    
         The smoke subsides.  CASTOR hangs crucified in the skeleton
         of the neon letters -- "HOTEL" now reads simply "H - - EL."
         Dead to the world, Castor's MOCKING SMILE still survives.
    
    
         EXT.  ROOFTOP -- NIGHT -- (LATER)
    
         A stately woman, flanked by two bodyguards, coolly examines
         CASTOR'S body as it's gurneyed into the freight elevator.
         This is regional NSA director VICTORIA LAZARRO (40s).
    
         She spots ARCHER waiting for the glass view elevator.
    
                                  LAZARRO
                        Jon --!
    
         ARCHER doesn't seem to hear.  He gets into the elevator.
    
    
         INT.  HOTEL -- GLASS ELEVATOR -- NIGHT
    
         ARCHER hits "down."  Before the doors close, LAZARRO
         squeezes inside.  The elevator descends.
    
                                  LAZARRO
                        Fine work, Jon.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Yeah, real fine.  Especially
                        all the casualties.
    
                                  LAZARRO
                        I'm complimenting you.
                        Can't you ever just say
                        "thanks"?
    
                                  ARCHER
                            (grudgingly)
                        ... Thanks.
    
                                  LAZARRO
                        Try to kiss my butt just
                        once before I'm transferred.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't
                        mentioned in the job
                        description.
    
         The elevator doors open.  They've arrived in --
    
         THE LOBBY
    
         Filled with agents, cops and press.  A REPORTER snaps a
         photograph of the pair.
    
                                  REPORTER
                        Hey, Archer, what's going
                        on?  How about a statement?
    
         Routinely, Archer gives his "statement" -- grabbing the man's
         Nikon.  He rips out the film -- then hands the camera back.
    
                                  LAZARRO
                        Jon -- bad press means bad
                        publicity means budget cuts.
                            (Archer doesn't respond)
                        Just have your report on my
                        desk by noon.
    
         Lazarro looks at Archer like he's some long-extinct species
         and walks away.  TITO steps up and slings an arm around Archer.
    
                                  TITO
                        Go home, Jon.  Tell Eve ...
    
    
         EXT.  SUNSET DISTRICT -- CAR -- MOVING -- DAY
    
         Exhausted -- ARCHER drives through the middle-class
         neighborhood, sipping a carton of milk.
    
    
         INT.  AN ORDINARY HOUSE -- DAY
    
         At the KITCHEN WINDOW:  EVELYN ARCHER (30) -- handsome,
         strong, reserved -- watches as ...
    
         ARCHER'S CAR rolls right past the house -- then jerks to a
         stop.  In reverse, it backs down the street -- back toward
         the house.  EVE shakes her head.  Same old story.
    
    
         EXT.  ARCHER HOME -- DAY
    
         On his way to the house, ARCHER picks up a basketball and
         takes a shot.  His form is terrible -- he misses by a mile.
    
    
         INT.  ARCHER'S HOME -- DAY
    
         ARCHER enters and sees EVE in her medical scrubs.  Her fiery
         auburn hair may be down, but she's decidedly cool.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Hi ...
                            (no response)
                        Where's Jamie?
    
         She nods toward the KITCHEN.  JAMIE is there -- a sullen and
         hard 12-year-old.  She's flanked by TWO COPS.
    
                                  EVE
                        She complimented her "D"
                        in physics with an "F"
                        in grad theft auto ...
    
    
         EXT.  ARCHER'S FRONT PORCH -- MINUTES LATER -- DAY
    
         Smiling, ARCHER shakes hands with the cops -- as they leave.
    
    
         INT.  ARCHER'S HOME -- DAY
    
         ARCHER shuts the door -- his smile disappears.  He turns and
         looks at Jamie, matter-of-factly pouring herself coffee.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Stealing a police car
                        from a car wash!  Are
                        you out of your mind?
    
                                  JAMIE
                        That's right.  Don't even
                        ask me what happened.
    
         Archer looks to Eve for help.  Eve shakes her head -- nope.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Okay.  What happened?
    
                                  JAMIE
                        Like you'd ever believe
                        me over a fucking cop!
    
         She bolts.  In anticipation, Eve calmly opens the door as
         Jamie rushes out, then closes it behind her.
    
                                  EVE
                        Well, you tried.  You failed
                        miserably, but you tried.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Everything I say is wrong.
                        I can't talk to her anymore.
    
                                  EVE
                        She's only 12.  Some day
                        she'll understand that apathy
                        and absence are just special
                        ways of saying "I love you."
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Is that what you think?
    
                                  EVE
                        Jon ... we just remember
                        how it used to be.
                            (heads for door)
                        You staying for a while or
                        is this just a piss-stop?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        We need to talk.
    
                                  EVE
                        I'm late for surgery.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        It's important.
    
                                  EVE
                        So is finishing my residency
                        and passing my boards ...
    
         But as Eve opens the door -- something in her husband's
         expression makes her stop cold.
    
                                  EVE (cont'd)
                        Jon -- what is it?
    
         But he's too overcome.  He starts to speak -- but can't.
    
                                  EVE (cont'd)
                        Is it -- him?  You
                        got him?
    
         Emotions avalanche across his face until he finally looks up.
    
                                  EVE (cont'd)
                        It's over, Jon?  It's
                        really over?
    
         For the first time -- ARCHER allows himself a thin SMILE.
         EVE pulls him close -- a sheltering embrace for them both.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        I'll make it up to you and
                        Jamie.  I'll put in for a desk
                        job.  This time, I mean it.
    
    
         INT.  ARCHER HOME -- MORNING
    
         Freshly dressed, Archer heads down the hall.  He pauses at
         the door to Jamie's room when he sees --
    
         INSIDE
    
         Fully clothed, Jamie is fast asleep on her bed cluttered
         with clothes and assorted girl-stuff.
    
         ARCHER steps inside -- looking at his daughter's now-
         peaceful face.  He looks around at her room ... sees the
         stuffed animals collecting dust ... make-up, jewelry ...
         his little girl is growing up fast.  And he's missing it.
    
         ARCHER carefully pulls the blanket up over her.  With a
         bittersweet smile, he slips out of the room.
    
    
         EXT.  PRESIDIO -- NSA HEADQUARTERS -- DAY
    
         A sprawling, high-security compound.  ARCHER negotiates the
         no-nonsense check-point manned by heavily-armed guards.
    
                                  GATE GUARD ED
                        Print, please, Commander.
    
         ARCHER presses his thumb to a scan-pad as guards inspect the
         car.  ED waves "all clear."  Archer drives in.
    
    
         INT.  LOBBY -- DAY
    
         The entry is dominated by the NSA OFFICIAL SEAL -- A cobalt-
         and-white glass mosaic of a stalwart eagle clutching a key.
    
         Color-coded elevators denote security status.  ARCHER uses a
         mag-card to enter the restricted "RED LEVEL" elevator.
    
    
         INT.  BULLPEN -- DAY
    
         Efficient as a beehive, agents, cryptologists, support staff
         buzz through their routines.  ARCHER strides past -- drawing
         assorted congratulatory nods and "thumbs up" signs -- but
         no one breaks work-stride.  He enters his ...
    
         RECEPTION AREA
    
         Archer's team is there.  Applauding.  Proud.  But Archer's
         uneasy with plaudits.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Much appreciated.  Now let's
                        get back to work, okay?
    
         He herds the disappointed agents out.
    
                                  WANDA
                            (to Buzz)
                        Is that stick ever gonna
                        fall out of his ass?
    
         Archer shuts the door, then turns to his attractively-built
         secretary -- KIM BREWSTER (25).
    
                                  KIMBERLY
                            (holds up champagne)
                        The CIA sent this over.
                        What should I do with it?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Send it back and tell
                        them to stop wasting
                        the taxpayers' money.
                            (a beat)
                        And Miss Brewster --
    
                                  KIMBERLY
                        Yes, Commander?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        It's against the law to
                        smoke in a federal building.
    
         He OPENS THE DRAWER, stomps out her cigarette, then exits
         to his inner office.  Kimberly sighs and turns to a CLERK.
    
                                  KIMBERLY
                        Three years -- and he still
                        calls me "Miss Brewster."
    
    
         INT.  ARCHER'S OFFICE -- DAY
    
         MOVING past photos, newsclips, clues and totems of CASTOR --
         a monument to his obsession -- we FIND ...
    
         ARCHER on the computer.  Like a guy who can't help but stare
         at a train wreck, he scrolls through ...
    
         CASTOR'S HOMICIDE VICTIMS FILE
    
         Face after face -- some innocent, some not -- flash past.
         Finally he stops at the image of a LITTLE BOY.
    
         All smiles and ruddy cheeks.  MATTHEW ARCHER'S a child with
         all the time in the world.
    
         Light floods in as TITO enters.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        How's Loomis?
    
                                  TITO
                        Apparently, fine.  He's
                        coming into work.  That's
                        the good news ...
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Go on.
    
                                  TITO
                        Castor's still alive --
                            (off Archer's reaction)
                        Technically.  He's a turnip,
                        on total life-support ...
    
         Tito pops a micro-disc into the desk-top.
    
                                  TITO (cont'd)
                        ... And I found this --
                        at his brother's flat ...
    
         A HOLO-IMAGE appears -- a 3-D image of the DEVICE.  Archer
         sags -- he knows it's a bomb ... and a complex one.
    
         Using a remote, Archer ENLARGES THE 3-D IMAGE.  The "bomb" is
         now 5'x5'x5' -- virtual reality without the helmet.  We step
         with Archer RIGHT INTO THE BOMB as he studies it.
    
                                  TITO (cont'd)
                        Porcelain casing ... thermal
                        neutron cloak ... I didn't
                        recognize the payload.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Some kind of designer toxin.
                            (moving into the core
                             then inspecting it)
                        Probably biological.
                        Definitely airborne.
    
         Archer's eyes sharpen -- it sinks in.
    
                                  ARCHER (cont'd)
                        "Worse than anything God
                        ever dumped on the Pharaohs."
    
         Enlarging the IMAGE, Archer examines it even more closely.
    
                                  ARCHER (cont'd)
                        Castor's sociopathic, but not
                        suicidal.  He wouldn't handle
                        anything this unstable without ...
    
         He traces a finger along the bomb's guts to a small
         appendage on the globe.  It's got a button.
    
                                  ARCHER (cont'd)
                        -- Here.  A fail-safe -- in
                        case the bomb goes critical
                        while being installed.
                            (a beat)
                        Find out how it works.
                        And call Lazarro -- tell
                        her I'm on my way up.
    
         DISSOLVE TO:  INTERROGATION FOOTAGE
    
         Pollux under the 3rd degree.  Wired to a complex machine --
         the interrogating Agents seem to have him on the run ...
    
         INT.  BRIEFING ROOM -- DAY
    
         ARCHER, LAZARRO and various NSA OFFICIALS watch the monitor.
    
                                  POLLUX
                            (on screen)
                        -- That bomb was just a
                        crossword puzzle to me ...
                        a mental exercise.  I
                        never built it ...
    
         Weary, LAZARRO shuts down the monitor ... turns to Archer.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        He's lying.
    
                                  LAZARRO
                        Jon, he's hooked up to
                        a full-spectrum polygraph.
                        No one has ever beaten --
    
                                  ARCHER
                        I don't care -- he's
                        manipulating it.  That
                        bomb has been built and
                        it's out there, somewhere.
    
                                  LAZARRO
                        What do you expect us to
                        do -- shut down the city,
                        evacuate two million people
                        on a hunch?
    
         Archer looks from Lazarro to the other officials.  He knows
         it's hopeless -- and gets up to leave.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        It isn't a hunch and
                        Castor doesn't bluff.
                        It's going to happen ...
    
    
         INT.  CORRIDOR -- DAY
    
         ARCHER stomps along, Tito at his heels.
    
                                  TITO
                        We can send in a plant
                        -- try to get Pollux to
                        spill the location.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        He'd see that a mile away.
                            (a beat)
                        The only person he'd talk
                        to about that bomb is his
                        brother.  Unfortunately,
                        turnips can't talk.
    
         Archer's mind races, there's got to be a way.
    
                                  TITO
                        I'll be damned.  Loomis ...
    
         LOOMIS is in the Squad Room -- not a scratch on him.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Which ear was it?
    
                                  TITO
                        The left, I think.  Those
                        surgeons in Witness
                        Protection can fix things
                        nobody's even broken yet.
    
         ARCHER says nothing.  Something dawns on him.  Something
         brilliant as it is insane.  Or is it simply insane ... ?
    
         FULL SCREEN:  LIFE-SIZE HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGES OF A MAN ... just

                                  HOAG'S VOICE
                        This informant marked
                        himself for death by
                        testifying against a drug
                        cartel, so he was sent to
                        me for a little makeover.
    
         PULL BACK TO:
    
         INT.  MEDICAL WING -- PHYSIOLOGICAL CAMOUFLAGE UNIT -- DAY
    
         Expertly working a joy-stick is DR. MALCOLM HOAG (50's).
         This man exudes genius and arrogance.  Archer's beside him.
    
                                  HOAG
                        A rhinoplasty here, a
                        mentoplasty there ...
    
         The Informant's NOSE narrows.  His CHIN strengthens.
    
                                  HOAG (cont'd)
                        Blepharoplasty, otoplasty ...
                        Everywhere a plasty, plasty.
    
         The Informant's big EARS shrink and his EYES morph.  The end
         result -- literally a NEW MAN.  Hoag nods matter-of-factly.
    
                                  HOAG (cont'd)
                        Physical augmentation, vocal
                        enhancement implants -- More
                        snitches have disappeared in
                        here than in San Francisco Bay.
                            (a beat)
                        Of course, it's easy to
                        make someone look like no
                        one ... But I'm always
                        tinkering with other methods.
    
         Using the joystick, Hoag strips away the Informant's "new"
         face and replaces it with a rotating FACIAL-SHELL -- fixed
         at various anchor-points.  Hoag's OWN IMAGE adheres on the
         shell and he "sculpts" it to fit the Informant's skull.
    
                                  HOAG (cont'd)
                        Using a morpho-genetic
                        template, the sub-structure
                        can be molded to the exact
                        shape of one man's skull;
                        the outside -- exactly like
                        another's.
                            (admires his own image --
                             now on the Informant)
                        Vast improvement, isn't it?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        So it is possible?
    
                                  HOAG
                        To temporarily borrow another
                        man's face?  Oh, yes.  I can
                        think of only one reason why
                        it's never been done --
                            (a beat)

                                  ARCHER
                        But will you do it?
    
                                  HOAG
                        Without approval -- totally
                        off the books as you say?
                        Commander, your proposal
                        would cost me my job and
                        get me banished from every
                        respectable medical
                        society in the world.
                            (a beat)
                        That's why I like it.
                        But can you find a
                        volunteer in time?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        -- I already have.
    
         HOAG almost asks "who" -- then stares at Archer and
         understands -- there's no one else for this job.
    
    
         INT.  ARCHER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
    
         The door to JAMIE'S room is plastered with news headlines
         and disturbing photos of police beatings and government
         corruption.  Loud music pounds out from within.  ARCHER
         pauses to knock -- then doesn't.  He lets it go.
    
    
         INT.  BATHROOM -- NIGHT
    
         ARCHER undresses, looking in the mirror.  Smooth-chested and
         reasonably toned -- he's getting a bit of a gut.
    
    
         INT.  BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS -- NIGHT
    
         EVE is in bed.  ARCHER comes in quietly and sits beside her
         -- studying her peaceful, half-sleeping face.  She stirs.
    
                                  EVE
                        ... I was dreaming ...
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Something good?
    
                                  EVE
                        We were back in high school.
                        You wanted to join the sky
                        diving team, but I wouldn't
                        let you.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Must've been after we
                        got engaged.
    
                                  EVE
                        Actually -- in this dream
                        -- I was your mother.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        So you had a nightmare.
    
                                  EVE
                        Totally -- you were being
                        very, very bad.  You went
                        up in the plane and jumped
                        out.  You had a parachute,
                        but it didn't open.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Were you there to catch me?
    
                                  EVE
                        No.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        How come?
    
                                  EVE
                        I don't know ...
                            (nuzzles him)
                        Maybe because you've
                        never needed my help.
    
         They kiss -- and keep kissing.  Their passion building, EVE
         runs her hands over his body -- reaching, touching.
    
         She pulls apart his shirt -- buttons popping -- revealing a
         thick round SCAR on his chest.  Her fingertips touch the
         bullet scar.  ARCHER freezes mid-caress.
    
                                  EVE (cont'd)
                        It's all right, Jon.
    
         But he is pulling away.  She won't let him -- she tugs him
         back onto the bed and enfolds him in her arms, holding him.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Five years ... I still
                        can't get it out of my
                        head -- an inch to the left,
                        Matty would still be alive.
    
                                  EVE
                        And you wouldn't be.
    
         No response.  The pain hidden in his stoic detachment chills
         Eve.  She musters a hopeful tone.
    
                                  EVE (cont'd)
                        Things will get better
                        now that you're home.
                        Everything will be better
                        now that ... that man is
                        finally out of our lives.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Eve ...
    
         He starts to mouth the words.  He wants, needs to share the
         truth with her.  But he can't.  Instead --
    
                                  ARCHER (cont'd)
                        ... If I had to do something
                        to find some closure ... I
                        should do it, shouldn't I?
                        ... No matter how crazy?
    
                                  EVE
                        What are you saying?
                            (realizes)
                        Oh, God -- you're going
                        on assignment again ...
    
                                  ARCHER
                        One last time.  It's important ...
    
                                  EVE
                        You said you'd be here!
                        You promised me -- you
                        promised Jamie!  What
                        could be more important
                        than that?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        I can't tell you ...
                        except only I can do it.
    
                                  EVE
                        You want me to tell you
                        it's okay to leave?  Okay,
                        go on!  GO!
    
         Fury erupting, Eve pushes Archer out of the bed.  He
         stumbles out of the room.
    
    
         INT.  HALLWAY -- NIGHT
    
         Archer trudges past Jamie's room.
    
    
         INT.  BEDROOM -- NIGHT
    
         He enters a boy's room -- neat and tidy, like a museum
         exhibit which, in a sense, it is.
    
         ARCHER clicks the wall switch -- no bulb.  He lies down on
         the small bed and stares at the ceiling.
    
         A STARFIELD
    
         twinkles back at him ... made of stick-on fluorescent stars
         and comets and day-glo stardust that spells "Matthew."
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Am I crazy, Matty?
    
         ARCHER'S weary eyes close as the stardust twinkles brightly.
    
         DISSOLVE TO:  BRIGHT LIGHTS -- the San Francisco skyline --
         dominated by the twin Transamerica Towers.
    
         INT.  TRANSAMERICA-TWO BUILDING -- NIGHT
    
         A MAINTENANCE WORKER sweeps up -- until a RAT scurries by.
         Annoyed, the man follows the vermin with the broom -- poking
         around -- trying to flush it out.
    
         Squeezing behind some DUCTS -- he spots something HIDDEN ...
         something GLOWING RED -- tapped into this a/c vent.
    
         He leans in closer and ... BREAKS AN ELECTRIC EYE -- the
         bomb's self-defense motion-detector.  Instantly a YELLOW
         LIGHT BEAM flashes -- finds the MAN'S FACE.  HISSSS!
    
         A pinpoint of gas sprays him.  He recoils and runs out.
    
    
         EXT.  BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS -- NIGHT
    
         Gasping for breath, the Man forces open an access door.
         That's better.  Then ... he CONVULSES VIOLENTLY.  Twitching,
         shuttering, he FALLS ... dropping like a wounded bird.
    
    
         EXT.  ALLEY BELOW -- CONTINUOUS -- NIGHT
    
         Splattered in the gutter, the man looks like just another
         jumper in the heartless big city.
    
    
         INT.  NSA -- ARCHER'S OFFICE -- DAY
    
         Archer memorizes the CD-ROM images before him:
         Surveillance footage of CASTOR dancing in a crowded night-
         club with a sexy but doped-up WOMAN.  They're necking.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Sasha Plummer, 28, single,
                        mother of one.  Met Castor
                        Troy in Berkeley at a Pearl
                        Jam reunion.  Felony convictions:
                        two counts, drug running.
                        She has a tattoo of a 1956
                        Buick on her right ankle.
    
         ZOOM in on the tattoo as the door opens -- TITO enters.
    
                                  TITO
                        Castor himself didn't
                        know half this crap,
                        and it was his life.
                            (hands Archer a disk)
                        What do you want with
                        the prison lay-out?
                        That place is so tight,
                        you couldn't squeeze
                        a fart out of there.
    
         Archer keeps working -- the image of Sasha MORPHS into
         footage of a slick, Eurotrash-type -- DIETRICH HASSLER (45).
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Dietrich Hassler.  45.
                        Biochemist.  Dismissed from
                        the FDA on charges of ...
    
         Tito shuts down the machine.
    
                                  TITO
                        Jon, this is goddam insane.
                        You can't go through with it.
                            (no response)
                        What about Eve?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        She doesn't know -- and she
                        never will.
    
                                  TITO
                        You haven't got a chance in
                        hell of fooling Pollux.
                        Castor drinks, smokes and
                        walks around with a 24-hour
                        hard-on.  He's nothing
                        like you.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Don't worry.  I've done
                        my homework.  I'll get
                        Pollux to talk.
    
                                  TITO
                        Either way, come Saturday
                        morning -- I'm pulling you
                        the hell out of there.
    
    
         EXT.  HOAG INSTITUTE -- DAY  (ESTABLISHING)
    
         The sun rises over a gated compound in the Berkeley hills.
    
    
         INT.  FACILITY -- O.R. -- DAY
    
         ON MONITORS:  CASTOR'S body is being prepped.
    
         PULL BACK:  Hoag confers with the ARCHIVE TECHY who's taping
         the procedure.
    
                                  DR. HOAG
                        Let's walk through it, Commander.
                            (a beat)
                        Your blood types are different,
                        but surgically compatible.  The
                        height difference is negligible
                        -- within 1/2 an inch.  The feet
                        are close enough.  Penis size,
                        flaccid, essentially the same.
                            (a beat)
                        Substantial.
    
         TWO NURSES exchange a glance.
    
                                  DR. HOAG (cont'd)
                        Eye color will be handled
                        with a retinal dye.  Body
                        hair -- with micro-grafts.
                        Teeth, a little cosmetic
                        bonding.  The tattoos will
                        be -- tattooed.  Fingerprints
                        -- we'll use an organic skin
                        mold and a little Crazy Glue.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Kid's stuff.
    
                             THE TRANSFORMATION
    
         TATTOOS:  A tattoo artist recreates the COLOSSUS OF RHODES
         on ARCHER'S thigh as his assistant outlines the remaining
         six "Ancient Wonders of the World."
    
         TEETH:  DR. HOAG works like an artist -- matching the color
         and shape of CASTOR'S teeth.
    
         EYES:  Lids pinned back -- micro-needles plunge into
         ARCHER'S eyeballs.  His irises WASH from brown to blue.
    
         BODY HAIR:  Hundreds of tiny grafts are "plugged" onto
         ARCHER'S chest.
    
         STOMACH:  HOAG prods ARCHER'S love handles.
    
                                  DR. HOAG
                        Abdominoplasty, Commander?
                        It's on the house.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Abdomino -- what?
    
                                  DR. HOAG
                        A tummy tuck.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Do it.
    
         Globules of adipose tissue siphon from ARCHER'S obliques.
    
         CHEST SCAR:  HOAG runs a finger along the jagged line.
    
                                  DR. HOAG
                        You realize, Commander --
                        this has to go.
    
         ARCHER looks at the scar -- then nods without a word.  Two
         surgeons begin to remove the dead tissue.
    
                                  DR. HOAG (cont'd)
                        Let's see if I missed
                        anything before I get
                        my hands really dirty.
    
         HOAG leads ARCHER to a mirror.  Archer's amazed to see:
    
         HIS OWN HEAD ON CASTOR'S BODY
    
         He's got a flat stomach, chest hair, blue eyes -- the works.
         Archer touches where his chest scar once was -- now gone.
    
    
         EXT.  HOAG'S FACILITY -- NIGHT
    
         Clear and calm.  God's night.  Someone's God anyway.
    
    
         INT.  HOAG'S FACILITY -- NIGHT
    
         ARCHER is wheeled into the high-tech surgical bay, CASTOR
         beside him.  Hoag wipes his brow -- he and his team have
         been working for hours and now comes the hard part.
    
                                  DR. HOAG
                        Here we go, Commander.
                        Through the Looking Glass ...
    
         ARCHER nods as the anesthesiologist injects his IV line.  As
         he drifts off, he can hear HOAG'S final instructions ...
    
                                  DR. HOAG (cont'd)
                        -- initial incision will be
                        made above the ear, extending
                        down behind the left earlobe,
                        then back up into the hairline.
    
         Hoag turns to the ARCHIVE TECHNICIAN who's video-taping all.
    
                                  DR. HOAG (cont'd)
                        Make sure you get everything
                        -- I'll need to study the tape
                        before reverse surgery.
    
         Hoag sets the tip of the LASER against Archer's forehead.
    
         A RED TARGET BEAM -- slender as a hair -- appears.  HOAG
         sights through the optical memory, squeezes the trigger and
         -- a COBALT BEAM cuts above Archer's ear.
    
         HOAG'S ASSISTANT performs the same procedure on CASTOR.
    
         HOAG peels ARCHER'S face away from his skull.
    
         HOAG carefully sinks Archer's face into a saline drip-tank.
    
                                  DR. HOAG (cont'd)
                        Vault it.
    
         The Nurse takes the container and rushes off.  HOAG pulls
         the MILKY TEMPLATE out of a saline dip and fits it over
         Archer's facial sub-structure.  It's a perfect fit.
    
                                  DR. HOAG (cont'd)
                        Come on -- the other one!
    
         His Assistant hurries -- peeling CASTOR'S face away.
    
         CASTOR'S CONSISTENT EEG READING suddenly SPIKES RADICALLY --
         for a moment, it almost seems to stabilize.  The Assistant
         glances over -- too late.  The read-out returns to normal.
    
         DISSOLVE TO:
    
         A head swathed in gauze.  The bandages start to fall away.
    
         INT.  RECOVERY ROOM -- DAY
    
         HOAG removes the gauze.  Gathering courage, Archer turns to
         the mirror and sees his new face.  The face of his most
         hated enemy -- now HIS face.
    
         Astounded, sickened to his core -- Archer has to catch his
         breath as he realizes ...
    
         JON ARCHER HAS BECOME CASTOR TROY
    
         TITO enters.  Instinctively, he grabs for his holster.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        It's me, Tito.  It's Jon.
    
         Tito smiles, realizes his reflexive stupidity.
    
                                  ARCHER (cont'd)
                        It worked ...
                            (clears throat)
                        Except for this.
    
                                  DR. HOAG
                        Yes -- the voice.
    
         ARCHER'S voice still sounds exactly like ARCHER.  HOAG
         prods around Archer's adam's apple.
    
                                  DR. HOAG (cont'd)
                        I implanted a micro-chip
                        onto your larynx -- a
                        prototype developed for
                        throat cancer survivors.
    
         HOAG switches on a digital recording.  ARCHER repeats CASTOR'S
         words as HOAG adjusts the chip with hand-held remote.
    
                     CASTOR'S VOICE                  ARCHER
                 I'm a Catholic, goddamn      I'm a Catholic, goddamn
                 it!  Why would I shoot       it!  Why would I shoot
                 the Pope?                    the Pope?
    
         After a few repetitions, ARCHER'S VOICE matches perfectly --
         if a little hoarse.
    
                                  DR. HOAG (cont'd)
                        As your chords adjust, the
                        scratchiness will pass.
    
         ARCHER yawns, squints and furrows his brow -- testing every
         muscle.  Slowly he turns to ...
    
         CASTOR.  Motionless, swathed, dead to the world -- but
         something about Castor's EYES -- those mocking eyes ...
    
                                  TITO
                        Now what?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Call Lazarro.  Castor
                        just came out of his coma.
    
    
         EXT.  NSA HELIPORT -- DAY
    
         A squad of MARINES double-time through a concrete passage
         and takes up position around a helipad.  A jet-black
         helicopter drops from the sky like an angry wasp.
    
    
         EXT.  HELI-PAD -- DAY
    
         A second squad of Marines marches out.  In their midst --
         Tito escorts a heavily-manacled "Castor."
    
                                  TITO
                        This is it, Jon.  For
                        the next 72 hours --
                        you're on your own.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Just make sure you're
                        there.  On time.
    
         Two armed AGENTS leap from the chopper and take charge of
         "Castor."  He follows them pliantly until --
    
                                  TITO
                        Watch this hard-case --
                        he'll bite your nuts off
                        if he gets the chance!
    
         ARCHER gets the message.  He starts to resist the Agents and
         must be muscled into the chopper.  He's manacled down.
    
         An AGENT starts to pull a HOOD over Archer's head.  EYE-
         CONTACT between Archer and Tito -- both aware of this very
         real point of departure.  The hood comes down.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Do I get a meal on
                        this flight?
    
         The AGENT smashes his elbow into ARCHER'S gut.  The door shuts
         -- the CHOPPER lifts off like a twister and screams away.
    
    
         EXT.  BALCONY ABOVE -- DAY
    
         The gang breaks up, wanders back to work.
    
                                  LOOMIS
                        What a week for Commander
                        Archer to go on vacation.
                        Maybe we should let him know.
    
                                  WANDA
                        Forget it.  He left strict
                        orders not to be tracked down.
    
                                  BUZZ
                        He'll shit when he finds
                        out Castor pulled through.
    
                                  WANDA
                        If he shits at all.
    
                                  BUZZ
                        Probably doesn't.
    
         DISSOLVE TO:
    
         INT.  STEEL HOLDING PEN -- EREWHON PRISON
    
         Day or night?  Who knows -- there's no natural light.
         Groggy, ARCHER stirs -- and removes his hood.
    
         He gets up -- and paces the tiny cubicle.  There are no
         doors, no windows -- the room appears seamless.  Even more
         odd, his movements don't make a sound.  TOTAL SILENCE.
    
         Archer BANGS on the wall, silently.  Then he opens his mouth
         and YELLS, also silently.  Has he gone mad?
    
         The faintest PNEUMATIC sound causes Archer to whirl.  Now
         behind him:  a pair of gleaming METAL BOOTS.
    
                                  VOICE
                        Put on the boots
    
         He examines them -- they're lined with electro-skin sensors.
    
                                  VOICE (cont'd)
                        Don't sniff 'em, you
                        perv.  Just put 'em on.
    
         Archer does as he's told.  Instantly, the boots
         automatically lace -- they shrink and lock onto his feet.
         The WALLS PART -- revealing head guard WALTON.
    
         Archer tries to move -- he can't, not even an inch.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        They're too tight.
    
                                  WALTON
                        So's a noose.  Now keep
                        your mouth SHUT.
    
         For emphasis, WALTON jolts ARCHER with his high-voltage
         SHOCK-STICK.  Archer buckles.  Two more GUARDS enter.  They
         cut away Archer's clothes.
    
                                  WALTON (cont'd)
                        You are now an inmate of the
                        world's toughest prison.  In
                        here -- you are no one.  You
                        own nothing.  When I say
                        your ass belongs to me -- I
                        mean it.  Bend over.
    
         Archer hesitates -- but Walton hefts the shock-stick.
         Archer relents -- his face reflects the degradation.  Naked,
         he exposes all to the cavity-searching Guard.
    
                                  WALTON (cont'd)
                        The entire prison's one
                        big magnetic field.  The
                        boots'll tell us where
                        you are -- every second
                        of the day.  Now WALK.
    
         Archer takes a clumsy step -- acclimating to the boots.
    
    
         INT.  SECURITY -- ANNEX
    
         Archer enters, now dressed in plain prison blues.  From this
         annex, he can see into SECURITY CENTRAL.  It looks like an
         air traffic control tower -- with monitors designed to keep
         problems and privacy at a minimum.
    
         Walton grabs Archer's RIGHT THUMB and presses it into a
         console security screen.  It forms an ELECTRONIC PRINT --
         positively identifying "Castor".
    
                                  WALTON
                        I've got fifty bucks says
                        you're dead by dinner.
                        Don't disappoint me.
    
    
         INT.  GENERAL POPULATION -- DAY
    
         Totally enclosed -- except sunlight and cloudy blue skies
         peek through a small SKYLIGHT -- five stories above.
    
         100 Inmates crowd tables as Trustees dole out the food.
         Silence falls as ARCHER enters.  One huge inmate, DOBBS,
         does a slow burn on seeing "Castor."
    
         ARCHER stares the inmates down and takes a seat.  he scans
         the room -- looking for Pollux.
    
                                  LITTLE MAN
                        Hey, Castor -- remember me?
    
         ARCHER looks across the table.  The mustache is familiar.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Waxy Wright.  Didn't
                        Jon Archer bust you for
                        poisoning five members of
                        the Canadian parliament?
    
                                  WAXY
                        They never should've voted
                        against U.S. statehood --
                        the scumbags.
                            (a beat)
                        We heard you got wasted.
    
         ARCHER sees the other inmates sizing him up.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Do I look wasted -- asshole?
    
                                  WAXY
                            (nervous)
                        You look great, Castor.
                        Really.  Here -- I got a
                        shot of your favorite --
                        Mescal.  Even has the worm.
    
         WAXY hands over a baby-food jar filled with Mescal.  ARCHER
         eyes it with trepidation, but everyone's waiting.  He downs
         it -- choking, sucking back his urge to puke.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        -- Hit the spot.
    
         Suddenly DOBBS leaps onto ARCHER and starts pummeling him.
         They slide across the table -- spilling everyone's lunch.
    
    
         INT.  SECURITY CENTRAL -- DAY
    
         The DEPUTY gets two RED BLIPS on his monitor.
    
                                  DEPUTY
                        I've got bio-rhythm jumps
                        -- two -- at the eatery.
    
                                  SECURITY CHIEF
                        Lock 'em down.
    
    
         INT.  GENERAL POPULATION -- DAY
    
         INMATES encircle them as Dobbs throws Archer across the room
         and stalks him.  Dazed, Archer staggers to his feet -- and
         sees the inmates looking at him -- unimpressed.
    
         Especially his "brother" Pollux -- who stares dubiously.
    
         DOBBS wades into Archer again -- this time Archer is ready.
         He blocks Dobbs's fist and punches back -- then ...
    
         ZAP!  The magnetic boots lock both Dobbs and Archer in
         place.  They can't move their feet.  Dobbs flails hopelessly
         -- but Archer's just out of reach.
    
         CRACK!  WALTON punches ARCHER in the diaphragm.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        What?  He started it!
    
         WALTON smashes ARCHER harder -- he hits the floor.
    
                                  ARCHER (cont'd)
                        When I get out of here --
    
                                  WALTON
                        You'll what?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        I'm going to have you fired.
    
         His statement is so ludicrous, WALTON laughs.  Everyone does.
         From the inmates' reactions, ARCHER knows he's been accepted.
    
         Walton turns his steely gaze on DOBBS.
    
                                  WALTON
                        That's two strikes, Dobbs.
                        One more -- you know
                        where you're going.
    
         The veiled threat dampens Dobbs's rage.
    
                                  WALTON (cont'd)
                        Back to your "suites,"
                        -- or no dinner.
    
         POLLUX waits as ARCHER drops into the line of cons.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Hey, bro ...
    
                                  POLLUX
                        You're not my brother.
                            (eyes dissecting Archer)
                        The brother I knew would
                        never have been caught by
                        that dumb fuck Archer.
                            (then ... grinning)
                        At least tell me the bomb
                        is still going off.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        They haven't found it
                        yet -- Listen, Pollux ...
    
                                  WALTON
                        Shut up!
    
         Walton jabs Archer with the shock-stick -- Archer drops as
         Pollux moves on -- finally chancing a concerned look back at
         his "brother" -- being abused by the Guards.
    
    
         INT.  ARCHER'S CELL -- NIGHT
    
         Archer sits in the tiny, steel framed cell.  Isolated,
         lonely, he realizes how easy it would be to go insane here.
    
         He stares out the skylight -- at the evening sky above.
    
    
         EXT.  HOAG INSTITUTE -- NIGHT
    
         An insanely starry night.  Van Gogh's night.  The night he
         cut off his ear, anyway.
    
    
         INT.  INTENSIVE CARE UNIT -- NIGHT
    
         CASTOR'S body lies inert.  His life-support machines
         flatlining.  Until the EEG SPIKES.  Once -- twice -- three
         times.  Brain wave activity increases -- and stabilizes.
    
         The fingers on CASTOR'S hand begin to move.  Then his fist
         clenches -- hard.  CASTOR'S head is swathed in gauze.  But
         his EYES pop open.
    
         Reflexively, CASTOR wrenches from the bed -- tearing out the
         tubes and wires that tether him to life-support.  He goes
         down -- in agony -- groaning.
    
         He struggles to his feet -- staggering through the lab --
         haphazardly upending equipment as he goes to the window.
    
         OUTSIDE:  He sees the lights of San Francisco across the
         Bay.  Much closer -- is UC Berkeley's Campanile tower.
    
         Castor's hand grips a wall-mounted phone.  He dials.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Lars ... it's me ... well,
                        believe it!  Somewhere
                        in fucking Berkeley ...
                            (shuffles some papers)
                        The "Hoag Institute."  Just
                        get the fuck over here.  And
                        bring me a double cappuccino,
                        'cause Jesus, do I have the
                        mother of all hangovers ...
                        What? ... Yeah, low-fat.
    
         He hangs up -- then catches the reflection of his bandaged
         FACE in the window.  He quickly unwraps the gauze.
    
         THE DISCARDED BANDAGES fall at his feet ... we don't see
         what Castor sees -- but we hear him SCREAM.
    
    
         INT.  HOAG'S PRIVATE OFFICE -- NIGHT
    
         HOAG removes his scrubs, then washes up -- the work-day over.
         His wife BRIDGET enters with dinner.
    
         Taking a bite, he HEARS something.  Listening, he calms down
         until -- the door BLOWS OPEN.  Castor's bodyguard LARS
         storms in -- the weapon trained on the terrified couple.
    
    
         INT.  CORRIDOR -- NIGHT
    
         Lars manhandles Hoag and his wife through the lab doors.
    
    
         INT.  LAB -- NIGHT
    
         At the COMPUTER STATION -- LUNT is at a retrieval terminal,
         scrolling through endless pages of data ... absorbing it all
         -- including the video log of Archer's surgery.
    
                                  HOAG
                        Who are you?  What
                        do you want?
    
         Lars shoves Hoag into the towering figure of ...
    
         A MAN WITHOUT A FACE
    
         Through shadows, we GLIMPSE at raw muscle, cartilage and
         bone.  The man takes a sip of cappuccino ... then grimaces.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        I want my face.
    
    
         INT.  "POPULATION" -- PRISON -- DAY
    
         Exercise hour.  ARCHER tosses up an air-ball to the jeers of
         the other inmates.  He heads toward POLLUX who lies on the
         infield astroturf, staring upward.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Pollux ...
    
                                  POLLUX
                        Shut up.
    
         POLLUX seems totally focused on the sky above -- a BIRD
         swoops over the skylight and disappears.
    
                                  POLLUX (cont'd)
                        There it goes again --
                        a bearded bellbird!
    
                                  ARCHER
                        So?
    
                                  POLLUX
                        So?  The procnias averano is
                        a South American bird.  The
                        flight here was only three
                        hours!  And yesterday a
                        European swallow flew by!
                        Where the fuck are we?
    
         ARCHER shrugs.  POLLUX lights a cigarette and passes it.
         Afraid of blowing his cover, Archer takes a drag -- gags.
    
                                  POLLUX (cont'd)
                        What's gotten into you?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        What do you mean?
    
                                  POLLUX
                        You shoot hoops like a
                        chick, you smoke like a
                        wuss, and -- I don't know
                        -- you're different.
    
         ARCHER takes a second drag and holds it -- then exhales
         right in POLLUX'S face.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        I was in a coma, Pollux.
                        I still feel like shit.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        Let me have a look.
    
         He sticks his finger under ARCHER'S eye and pulls down like
         a vet examining a sick dog.  ARCHER pushes him off.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Do you know what it is
                        to be in a coma?  It
                        fucks up everything --
                        including your memory!
                        I can't even tell you why
                        Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
    
                                  POLLUX
                        You porked his wife the
                        day he was arrested.  How
                        could you forget that?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        I don't know.  Everything's
                        jumbled -- so you're going
                        to have to help me fill in
                        a few blanks.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        A few blanks?  Like what?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Like ...
    
         Archer rolls up his shirt, exposing the PYRAMID tattoo.
    
                                  ARCHER (cont'd)
                        ... I know I got this on
                        my tenth birthday.  But
                        I can't remember why.
    
         Archer lays the trap.  Suspicious, Pollux falls right into it.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        Come on ... that was the
                        wort day of our lives!
    
         ARCHER feigns a "struggle" with his memory.  He lights a
         butt with the old -- chain-style ... then "remembers."
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Oh, God -- Mom OD'd
                        at County General.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        Retching and convulsing
                        while those bastards didn't
                        even try to save her sorry
                        ass.  You gave her mouth to
                        mouth -- man -- even then
                        you had some constitution.
    
         ARCHER reacts -- he didn't know this side of Castor.
    
                                  POLLUX (cont'd)
                        Remember what you swore
                        to me at the funeral?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Uh -- to kill the doctors?
    
                                  POLLUX
                        After that.  You promised
                        you'd always take care of me.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        And I bet I've kept
                        that promise ...
    
                                  POLLUX
                        Only one you've never broken.
    
         Pollux looks at him with great affection.  Uncomfortable,
         Archer returns the look -- then returns to his true task.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Fuck the past.  We've
                        got the future to look
                        forward to.
    
         Archer pulls out a couple of liquid-filled baby food
         containers.  He passes one to Pollux and smiles.
    
                                  ARCHER (cont'd)
                        We still have Saturday night.
    
         Pollux downs the booze.  Archer just takes a sip.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        No shit.  Man, that was
                        going to be one big pay day.
    
         Archer refills Pollux's container and lights another
         cigarette for him.  He gulps it down.
    
                                  POLLUX (cont'd)
                        Five million bucks -- and
                        now the fucking Taiwanese
                        get to keep it all.
    
         Taiwanese?  Archer's mind whirls as he pours Pollux another.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        That's not the worst part.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        What's worse than losing
                        five million bucks?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Being stuck in this rat-hole
                        when it blows.  Bro, what you
                        built was a work of art.
                        That little fucker belongs
                        in the Smithsonian.
    
         Pollux beams and keeps drinking.  Archer hangs on every word.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        Yeah -- well ... the
                        new Transamerica Tower
                        will have to do ...
    
         ARCHER'S eyes widen almost imperceptibly.  But he simply
         nods -- solemnly keeping a straight face.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Thanks, Pollux.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        For what?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        For being one helluva guy.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        "Thanks?"  I guess they
                        really did fuck you up.
    
         Pollux chuckles -- until his eyes light on Archer's jar --
         still filled to the brim with booze.
    
    
         INT.  ARCHER'S CELL -- DAY
    
         ARCHER jots down notes when his cell door rolls open.
         WALTON is looking at him with cool respect.
    
                                  WALTON
                        Somebody wants to see you.
    
         ARCHER smiles to himself -- pleased at Tito's timeliness.
    
    
         INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM -- DAY
    
         ARCHER sits as the steel barrier rises.  But his confidence
         evaporates into unspeakable horror.  Because he finds
         himself staring into the brown eyes of --
    
         JON ARCHER.  This man has Archer's face -- his real face.
    
                                  IMPOSTOR
                        What's the matter?  Don't
                        you like the new me?
    
         ARCHER studies the image of his former self -- trying to
         understand.  Then he recognizes the SMIRK on the face, the
         mocking TWINKLE in the eyes and he says what he cannot say ...
    
                                  ARCHER
                        -- Castor?
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Not anymore.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        It can't be.  It's impossible.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        I believe the phrase Dr.
                        Hoag used was "titanically
                        remote."  Who knows?  Maybe
                        the trauma of having my face
                        cut off pulled me out.  Or
                        maybe God really is on
                        my side after all.
                            (a beat)
                        By the way, I know you don't
                        get the papers in here.
    
         He holds up the current Chronicle.  The headline reads:
    
         "INFERNO AT HOAG INSTITUTE -- Malcolm Hoag, Six Others Dead"
    
                                  CASTOR (cont'd)
                        Terrible tragedy.  Hoag was
                        such a genius -- but selfish
                        with his artistry.  I actually
                        had to torture his wife
                        to convince him to perform
                        the same surgery on me.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        You killed them?
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Of course I killed them,
                        you DUMB FUCK.  And torched
                        every shred of evidence that
                        proves who you really are.
                            (a beat)
                        Swallow this one, Commander.
                        You are going to be in here
                        for the rest of your life.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        What are you going to do,
                        Castor?
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Let's not confuse things
                        anymore.  I'm Archer.
                        You're Castor.  But if
                        you need proof --
    
         CASTOR opens his shirt -- there is a jagged BULLET SCAR
         identical to the scar once on Archer's chest.
    
         ARCHER'S mind reels -- he's shaking, losing control.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        What are you going to do!
    
                                  CASTOR
                        You've given me the freedom
                        I haven't had in years, and
                        the power to make it pay off
                        in ways I never thought
                        possible.  But hell -- this
                        is America.  One day a
                        pauper, the next day, a prince.
                        And I owe it all to you.
                        Now if you'll excuse me,
                        I've got an important
                        government job to abuse,
                        -- and a beautiful wife
                        to fuck.  Excuse me --
                        I mean "make love to."
    
         ARCHER freaks out.  Two Guards grab his arms and try to drag
         him down, but Archer throws them off.
    
         CASTOR impassively buttons his shirt as Archer pounds on the
         barrier -- trying to break through -- as Walton zaps him.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        That's not me!  That's not me!
    
         The Guards finally drag the kicking Archer out the door.
    
                                  WALTON
                        Sorry, Commander.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        It's quite all right.
                        You never know what
                        to expect from a
                        psychopathic criminal.
    
    
         INT.  CELL BLOCK -- DAY
    
         The Guards dump ARCHER into his cell.
    
                                  WALTON
                        You better be nice, Castor.
                        You could get mighty lonely
                        now that Pollux is gone.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Pollux is -- what?
    
                                  WALTON
                        Archer cut him a deal for
                        turning state's evidence.
                        He's free.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Walton, you have to let
                        me see the warden --
    
                                  WALTON
                        Or what?  You'll have me fired?
    
         Walton pushes a button.  STEEL PANELS close off the cell --
         silencing Archer's protesting voice.
    
    
         INT.  CELL -- SAME TIME
    
         ARCHER pounds at the mirrored cell door, finding no release
         from the horror.  He stares at the face of his enemy -- the
         enemy who now has total command of his life.
    
    
         EXT.  STREETS OF S.F. -- DAY
    
         Castor drives Archer's car.  He punches into the vehicle's
         portacomp and smirks as the computer obeys ...
    
    
         EXT.  NOE VALLEY -- NIGHT
    
         TITO lugs grocery bags up to his Victorian flat.
    
    
         INT.  TITO'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
    
         TITO enters and drops his gear, making his way to the
         refrigerator.  He opens it -- throwing LIGHT into the room
         -- revealing a MAN sitting at the wet bar.
    
         Tito whips out his gun, then sees it's "JON ARCHER."
    
                                  TITO
                        Jon?  What the hell happened?
    
                                  CASTOR
                        You're a secret agent
                        -- you tell me.
    
         CASTOR has laid the bait.  He waits ... and waits ... as
         TITO studies him.  Then, Tito lowers his gun.
    
                                  TITO
                        Christ, you're in a mood.
                            (pops a beer)
                        Okay -- you had to pull
                        out.  Pollux wasn't
                        fooled for a minute.
    
         Castor knows all he needs to know.
    
                                  TITO (cont'd)
                        That's what happened, right?
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Dead right.  Now -- how
                        about a beer for me?
    
                                  TITO
                        You ... sure.  Hang on --
                        if Hoag's dead, how'd you
                        switch back?  And ...
                            (uneasy)
                        ... who pulled you out?
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Nobody.
    
         CASTOR watches the terror build in Tito's eyes.  He waits
         just long enough for Tito to go for his gun, then ... BOOM!
         Castor fires and TITO slumps to the floor.
    
                                  CASTOR (cont'd)
                        I'll take that beer now.
    
    
         INT.  ARCHER'S CAR -- MOVING -- NIGHT
    
         Sipping a beer, CASTOR cruises through the middle-class
         neighborhood.  He smokes absently, clutching Archer's
         address on a Post-It.
    
         He drives past peaceful scenes of suburban bliss:  men on
         hammocks;  women chatting;  kids playing tag.
    
                                  CASTOR
                            (sickened)
                        Jesus, what a life.
    
         CASTOR tries to catch a street address and rolls past ...
    
         ARCHER'S HOUSE
    
         Dressed for work, EVE watches blandly as the car goes by.
         A moment later, it backs up and parks.
    
         CASTOR forces a smile -- then realizes there's a cigarette
         in his hand.  He quickly stamps it out.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Hi, uh -- Eve.  Can
                        you believe I drove
                        right by the house?
    
         Eve rolls her eyes -- what else is new?  Castor looks her
         over -- she's much sexier than he expected.  But EVE
         misreads his fascination with her cleavage -- and brushes a
         loose thread off her blouse.
    
                                  EVE
                        What happened to your
                        big "assignment"?
    
                                  CASTOR
                        What do you know about it?
    
                                  EVE
                        As much as ever.  Nothing.
    
                                  CASTOR
                            (relaxing)
                        It didn't work out as planned.
                        Where are you off to?
    
                                  EVE
                        The hospital.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        The hospital?
                            (spots her medical bag)
                        Oh, that's right --
                        you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
    
                                  EVE
                        Jon -- I don't have time
                        to play games.  There're
                        leftovers in the fridge.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Have fun at work.
    
         CASTOR kisses her -- rather hard -- on the mouth.
    
                                  EVE
                        What is with you tonight?
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Don't I usually kiss my wife?
    
                                  EVE
                        No.
    
         She gets in the car and pulls out.
    
    
         INT.  ARCHER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
    
         CASTOR steps inside, looks around.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        What a dump.
    
    
         INT.  MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT
    
         CASTOR sifts through Christmas cards from holidays past,
         studying the ones with photos.  He's memorizing -- matching
         names to faces -- Wanda's, Buzz's, Lazarro's, etc.
    
         Then something catches his eye.  He pulls down a
         floral notebook -- EVE'S DIARY -- and pages through it.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        He hasn't done her in
                        two months?  What a loser ...
                            (checks his pockets)
                        There's gotta be one
                        cigarette in this hole.
    
    
         INT.  ARCHER'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
    
         CASTOR rifles through the immaculate desk, searching for a
         cigarette, when he hears a voice.  He turns and glances
         across the hallway.  He sees ...
    
         GLIMPSES OF JAMIE
    
         As she walks back and forth in her room, talking on the
         phone -- and wearing only panties and a cropped t-shirt.
         CASTOR steps closer -- enjoying the view.
    
    
         INT.  JAMIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
    
         Miffed, JAMIE stamps out her lit cigarette.
    
                                  JAMIE
                        -- You're lying, Karl, I
                        E-mailed you three times --
                            (spots CASTOR at door)
                        Hang on a sec ...
    
         She slams it -- but he gets his foot inside.  Castor pushes
         menacingly into the room.
    
                                  JAMIE (cont'd)
                        I'll call you back.
                            (to Castor)
                        You're not respecting
                        my boundaries.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Screw your boundaries,
                        Janie.  You have something
                        I want.
    
                                  JAMIE
                        Janie?
    
         Castor spots her correct name embroidered on a pillow.  He
         gazes seductively, unnerving JAMIE as he steps toward her.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        I don't think you heard
                        me ... Jamie ... You have
                        something I want ...
    
         He reaches for her -- and RIGHT PAST HER.  He picks up a
         pack of cigarettes from the desk.
    
                                  JAMIE
                        Clarissa left those here.
    
                                  CASTOR
                            (shrugs and lights up)
                        I won't tell mom if you don't.
    
                                  JAMIE
                        When did you start smoking?
    
                                  CASTOR
                        You'll be seeing a lot
                        of changes around here.
                        Daddy's a new man.
    
         CASTOR blows a perfect smoke ring in her face, then goes
         out.  JAMIE just stares, astonished.
    
    
         EXT.  THE STRAND -- NIGHT
    
         Pollux and the twins hustle Hookers when Castor arrives.  He
         flashes a smile, then his NSA badge.  The girls scram.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        You merciless bastard!
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Business first.
                            (to twins)
                        I went into the "Warrants"
                        system and erased your
                        records.  You're clean.
                            (tosses them money rolls)
                        In fact, you're now on
                        the informant payroll.
    
         Castor sees Pollux studying "his" face -- with disgust.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        I can't even look at you
                        without wanting to vomit.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        You better get used to it.
                        That bitch Lazarro is getting
                        kicked upstairs.
                        Guess what white-bread family
                        man is going to replace her?
    
         CASTOR shoots Pollux a cheesy white-bread Archer smile.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        You can't be serious --
    
         Then Pollux falls silent, his mind clicking like an abacus.
         Suddenly ecstatic, he kisses Castor.
    
                                  POLLUX (cont'd)
                        It's the perfect cover.
                        You'll have the highest
                        security clearances, access
                        to everything and everyone, a
                        private army at your disposal!
                        If information is power --
    
                                  CASTOR
                        -- I'll be one of the most
                        powerful men in the country.
                        Didn't matter how much cash
                        I made pulling wet jobs --
                        I was still too low on the
                        food chain -- always with
                        somebody like Jon Archer
                        after me.  The best part
                        is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        No -- the best part is,
                        since it's a government
                        job -- they can't fire you!
                            (a beat)
                        But how can you be sure
                        you'll get the appointment?
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Trust me.  You're gonna
                        love it ...

                        A biological bomb was
                        discovered this morning in
                        the climate control system
                        of the Transamerica-Two Tower
                        in San Francisco.  A group of
                        Japan's leading geneticists
                        were the target ... (etc.)
    
         ARCHER watches in stony silence as --
    
         ON SCREEN -- THE TRANSAMERICA-TWO BUILDING
    
         The squad LEADER emerges -- the complex bomb cradled in his
         arms.  He dramatically unscrews a detonator cap -- and
         heaves the now-harmless device into the disposal container.
    
         People cheer as the leader removes his helmet and breathes a
         sigh of relief.  It's CASTOR.  He turns to the cameras and
         smiles broadly -- giving a "thumbs up" sign.

                                  CASTOR
                        That's classified.  But
                        if he's listening I have
                        a message for him:  Nice
                        try.  Now you know who's
                        really in charge.
    
         BACK TO ARCHER:  Totally enraged.  And totally powerless.
         Then his eyes focus ... he watches closely as --
    
         A GUARD uses his "Thumbprint ID" to get through the SECURITY

         Castor enters.  Some workers nod, some give a "thumbs up,"
         some smile -- but no one stops working.  They know better
         than to react, much less applaud.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Don't you guys watch TV?
                        Where's the parade?
    
         They look at each other -- afraid.  But proud rookie LOOMIS
         starts clapping, so everyone else joins in rousing applause.

         CASTOR enters to find MISS BREWSTER bent over the filing
         cabinet.  He watches her butt until she notices.
    
                                  KIMBERLY
                        Oh -- Commander.  I
                        didn't see you ...
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Well, I saw you -- Kim.
    
                                  KIMBERLY
                        Kim?
    
                                  CASTOR
                        That's your name, isn't it?
    
                                  KIMBERLY
                        You always call me Miss Brewster.

                        formal from now on, shall we?
    
         He gives her a playful slap on her rump.  She's stunned.
    
                                  KIMBERLY
                        You've got someone in

         CASTOR enters to find LAZARRO ensconced on the sofa.  She's
         fixated by the repeat TV coverage of the bomb being diffused.
    
                                  LAZARRO
                        Look at you, Jon -- at your
                        age -- an American hero!
                            (a beat)
                        I'd buy you a drink but I
                        know you'd just turn me down.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Normally, I would.  But today ...
    
         Castor opens a drawer and pulls out a bottle of Jamesons and
         two high-ball glasses.  He expertly pours two healthy shots.
    
                                  CASTOR (cont'd)
                        To the future, Admiral.
                        Yours -- and mine.

                        Practicing our executive
                        signature, are we?
    
         CASTOR takes away the pad on which he has, indeed, been
         practicing Archer's handwriting.
    
                                  LAZARRO (cont'd)
                        If I didn't know any better,
                        I'd say you were finally
                        kissing my butt ... and I
                        bet I know why.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        You're the only person in
                        this place who can see
                        right through me.
    
                                  LAZARRO
                        You've made us look pretty
                        good in the past week.  And
                        the way you handled the press --
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Just following your example.
    
                                  LAZARRO
                        D.C.'s very high on giving
                        you the promotion.  There's
                        just one problem.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        What's that?
    
                                  LAZARRO
                        Me.
                            (a beat)
                        I have doubts about your
                        ability to stick with what
                        is essentially a desk job.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        I had doubts too.  I always
                        looked at a desk as though
                        it were a ball-and-chain.
                        But something happened ...
    
         She nods -- waiting for the confession.  He leans in.
    
                                  CASTOR (cont'd)
                        I came back from a mission
                        and found strangers in my house.
                        Only they weren't strangers,
                        they were my wife and child.
                            (misty-eyed)
                        Five years my life was on hold.
                        While I chased the elusive, but
                        brilliant, Castor Troy.  I've
                        earned the right to start living
                        again.  So when I look at this --
                            (taps desk)
                        I don't see a ball-and-chain.
                        I see an anchor -- for me and
                        my family.
    
         Castor waits as Lazarro lets the speech sink in.  Then ...
    
                                  LAZARRO
                        You'd have to start
                        immediately.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Done.  In fact, I was
                        already plotting about
                        the best way to meet the
                        foreign bureau chiefs.
    
                                  LAZARRO
                        Jon, you're starting to
                        remind me -- of me.
                            (warm smile)
                        Congratulations.
    
         LAZARRO exits.  Castor eases himself into Archer's leather
         chair -- he picks up a framed photo of Archer & family and
         grins wide -- trying to ape Archer's dumb photo smile.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Jon -- you'd be so proud ...
    
         Castor puts the photo down, then pulls out a handbook:
    
              "You and the N.S.A:  A Primer for New Employees."
    
    
         EXT.  ARCHER'S HOME -- DAY
    
         CASTOR, carrying grocery bags, comes into the backyard where
         JAMIE practices free throws.  He watches her miss again.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Get a higher arc on the
                        ball, Jamie.  And for
                        Chrissake, square your
                        shoulders to the basket.
    
                                  JAMIE
                        Like you know anything
                        about it.
    
         CASTOR grabs the ball.  Despite the encumbrance of the
         groceries ... SWISH!  He crisply sinks the ball.
    
                                  CASTOR (cont'd)
                        Now square your shoulders
                        to the goddamn basket.
    
         He goes inside.  Then JAMIE takes his advice.  Shoulders
         squared, Jamie sinks a clean shot.  She's impressed.
    
    
         INT.  ARCHER'S HOME -- NIGHT
    
         Laden with text-books, EVE is greeted at the door by JAMIE.
    
                                  EVE
                        Where are you going?
    
                                  JAMIE
                        Chinatown.
    
                                  EVE
                        On a school night?
    
                                  JAMIE
                        Dad said it was OK.  Have fun.
    
         JAMIE kisses her and exits.  EVE'S confusion grows when she
         sees the dining room -- it's set for a candlelight dinner.
         CASTOR enters, dressed nicely, opening a bottle of wine.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Hurry up -- the salad's
                        getting warm and the
                        pasta's getting cold.
    
                                  EVE
                        -- I've got to study.
    
         He confidently pulls the books from her grasp.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        I can't believe you forgot.
                        Eve -- it's Date Night.
    
         DINING ROOM -- LATER
    
         CASTOR'S eyes twinkle as EVE looks up from her pasta.
    
                                  EVE
                        Why do I feel like I'm
                        on a blind date?
    
                                  CASTOR
                        They say love is blind.
                        Do you think that's true?
    
         EVE smiles playfully as he pours her more wine.
    
                                  EVE
                        I think -- you're trying
                        to get me drunk.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Wouldn't be the first
                        time -- or would it?
    
                                  EVE
                        You wouldn't even sip
                        champagne at our wedding.
                        We were underage -- you
                        wouldn't break the law.
                            (giggling)
                        Remember what my brother
                        called you?
    
         An awkward silence ...
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Who could forget?  I was
                        so young and clumsy then --
    
         Castor "accidentally" knocks over his glass, spilling wine --
         and, of course, conveniently changing the subject.
    
                                  CASTOR (cont'd)
                        Some things never change.
    
         They both mop up the mess with napkins until their fingers
         lightly touch, then intertwine.  A charge of sexual tension.
         As they almost kiss ... she becomes cautious.
    
                                  EVE
                        So -- how long will you
                        be gone this time?
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Gone?
    
                                  EVE
                        Isn't that what all this
                        is about?  Letting Jamie
                        go out, cooking me dinner,
                        -- your next assignment?
    
                                  CASTOR
                        I'm not going anywhere.
    
                                  EVE
                        You always say that --
                        then you leave.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Can't you see I'm trying
                        to change?  I sent Jamie
                        off because I wanted to be
                        alone with you.  I wanted
                        to see the candle-light
                        dance in your beautiful --
    
         Uh-oh.  CASTOR can't tell the color of EVE'S eyes.  He leans
         in "romantically" -- but WE know the real reason.
    
                                  CASTOR (cont'd)
                        -- brown eyes.
    
         He smells her hair, then her shoulders, her skin.  She's
         aroused, but wary.  So Castor goes in for the kill.
    
                                  CASTOR (cont'd)
                        I wanted it to be just
                        right ... when I told
                        you about my promotion.
    
                                  EVE
                        -- what?
    
                                  CASTOR
                        I'm replacing Lazarro.
                        Nice, safe desk job --
                        just like you wanted.
    
                                  EVE
                        ... That's great.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        So you see, I'm not
                        going anywhere.  Unless
                        it's upstairs with you ...
    
         CASTOR sweeps EVE up in his arms and heads for the stairs.
    
    
         INT.  BATHROOM -- NIGHT
    
         CASTOR carries EVE into the shower and spins on the water.
    
                                  EVE
                        You're wearing your suit --
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Call me spontaneous.
    
         There's nothing she can do as he rips her clothes apart --
         on her like a vulture to carrion.  They drop to the floor of
         the stall -- water filling up around them.
    
                                  CASTOR (cont'd)
                        ... I feel like I'm having
                        you for the first time ...
    
    
         INT.  ARCHER'S CELL -- NIGHT
    
         Desperately alone, seemingly without hope -- ARCHER huddles
         in a skimpy blanket.  He barely stirs as ...
    
         WALTON does his rounds of the darkened cells, then stops at
         the CELL BLOCK SECURITY DOOR.  The head guard uses his thumb
         print to clear security -- then types in his clearance code.
    
         BACK TO ARCHER'S CELL
    
         The instant the DOOR SLAMS shut, ARCHER rights himself.  He
         pulls out a LIGHTER and sparks it -- holding the flame to
         his THUMB.
    
         The skin melts like wax, but Archer doesn't cry out.  He
         peels off the skin graft -- the mold of Castor's fingerprint
         -- revealing his OWN.
    
    
         INT.  AQUACADE ANNEX
    
         The inmates are naked -- but still wearing their lock-down
         boots -- as they are herded into the prison SHOWER.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Don't they ever let us
                        take these boots off?
    
                                  WAXY
                        Not unless you're sent
                        to the "Clinic."
    
                                  ARCHER
                        You mean if I get sick?
    
                                  WAXY
                        They don't give two fucks
                        about your health.  The
                        Clinic's where they send
                        the real hard-cases for
                        attitude adjustment.
                            (whispering)
                        Look at O'Neill --
    
         WAXY gestures to an inmate nearby -- O'NEILL -- who smiles
         blankly, oblivious to the streaming delousing spray.
    
                                  WAXY (cont'd)
                        -- Toughest bastard I
                        ever saw -- after you,
                        of course -- now he's
                        a fucking drool case.
    
         ARCHER looks hard at O'Neill, whose eyes are glazed like a
         jelly donut.  Something BAD happened to this man.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        What did he do?
    
                                  WAXY
                        He hit a guard.
    
         BY THE AQUACADE ENTRANCE
    
         A GUARD reads a magazine.  Suddenly water drips on the
         pages.  The Guard looks up to see Archer standing a little
         too close to him -- he leaps up.
    
                                  GUARD
                        Looking for trouble, Castor?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Actually ... yes.
    
         CRACK!  Archer decks the Guard.  A second Guard charges in
         -- Archer heaves him across the shower.  Suddenly --
    
         WHAM!  Archer is flung hard against the shower wall.  He
         can't resist as HIS BOOTS spin him like a tornado and CRASH
         him into the opposing wall.  He collapses -- out cold.
    
    
         INT.  PRISON -- POPULATION -- NIGHT
    
         Night-time:  crescent moon, twinkling stars and a HOOT OWL.
         Searchlights sweep past the skylight.
    
         WALTON and a GUARD herd ARCHER toward a hydraulic steel door.
    
    
         INT.  THE "CLINIC" -- NIGHT
    
         The air-locks WHOOSH open.  The Guards enter and dump Archer
         on the floor.  He gets his bearings -- sees he's lying in a
         PUDDLE of something.  He looks up -- and recoils.
    
         ARCHER'S P.O.V.:  DOBBS is strapped to a verticle-gurney --
         post-procedure.  His limbs are stiff, his eyes blank as a
         Mako shark's.  And his feet are bare -- BOOTLESS.
    
                                  MED-TECH
                        Get a mop, he puked
                        all over the place.
    
         An Assistant unstraps Dobbs and drops him on a rolling
         GURNEY;  the Guard wheels him out.
    
                                  MED-TECH (cont'd)
                            (mopping up)
                        -- next time, bring them
                        in BEFORE dinner ...
    
         ARCHER cases the place:  equipment fed by tubes and cables
         run upward through the overhead ceiling grid.  Above the
         grid is the VIEW WINDOW of the Security Central Control.
    
         Walton muscles Archer into the gurney.  The Med-Tech smirks.
    
                                  MED-TECH (cont'd)
                        Oh happy day -- Castor Troy.
                        Too bad Jon Archer isn't
                        here to see this ...
    
         The Med-Tech wheels the ECT HEAD-GEAR cart into place: twin
         needle-like BOLTS ready to fit into ARCHER'S ears.  A single
         blue static spark jumps from the bolts.
    
         WALTON roughly wedges ARCHER'S HEAD into the head-gear,
         shoving the chewed-up bite-strap into Archer's mouth.
    
                                  WALTON
                        Bite hard, scumbag, 'cause
                        you'll be gumming baby
                        food from here on out.
    
                                  MED-TECH
                        Get his boots, Sergeant.
    
         WALTON unlocks ARCHER'S first boot and pulls it off.  As
         the Med-Tech starts to fasten Archer's arm -- Walton unlocks
         and pulls off the second boot.
    
         ARCHER'S FEET are free.  CRACK!  He yanks his foot up hard
         -- Walton reels back, stunned.
    
         One ARM still restrained, Archer BACKROLLS in the gurney and
         KICKS the Head Gear cart away -- knocking it into the Med-
         Tech who collapses onto it, hitting "TEST" --
    
         ZAP!  The head-bolts fire, catching the Med-Tech through the
         shoulder -- he drops to the floor, his synapses shot.
    
         The Assistant flees in terror as WALTON gropes for his
         weapon.  But ARCHER pulls his arm free and cracks Walton
         across the chin -- putting him out.
    
         ARCHER grabs Walton's shock-stick, hears the ALARM.  He
         shuts the door -- then jams the shock-stick into the key-
         mechanism.  ZAP!  It fuses shut.
    
         Using the floor-to-ceiling MATRIX OF SUPPORT CABLES --
         Archer free-climbs upward.
    
         A groggy WALTON forces open the door from inside.
    
         GUARDS pour in.  Walton grabs an auto-rifle and opens fire.
    
         SLUGS chase ARCHER as he climbs higher.  Riddled, tubes
         BURST, raining fluids and gases down on the Guards.
    
         ARCHER'S now directly in front of the Security Control
         window.  The Deputies inside watch frantically as Archer
         grabs the nearest cable and swings --
    
    
         INT.  SECURITY CENTER CONTROL -- NIGHT
    
         CRASH!  The window explodes inward.  ARCHER rides the cable
         into the booth -- and gets jumped by the Deputies inside.
    
         ARCHER slams the Security Chief into the control panel, then
         jolts the Deputy with the shock-stick.  The place is HIS.
    
         He finds what he's looking for:  a CROSS-CUT SCHEMATIC of
         the prison.  He traces his finger -- confirming his way out.
         He hits the keys -- typing furiously.
    
         FULL SCREEN -- THE MONITOR
    
         It splits into four sub-screens, each filled with the CGI of
         various HELICOPTERS .. ARCHER commits to memory each ship's
         TETHER CODE ... "Dancer," "Prancer," "Comet," etc.
    
         Then he wildly yanks out wires and shatters the computer
         banks.  FLAMES burst out -- shorting the circuitry.
    
         A DRONING SOUND rises -- the magnetic power monitor shows a
         dangerous surge.  ARCHER takes off into the corridor.
    
         AROUND THE PRISON:  Total chaos.
    
         EATERY:  Table and chairs FLY to the ceiling and STICK.
    
         THE KITCHEN:  The Staff scatters as KNIVES and POTS and
         STEEL UTENSILS hail through the kitchen,
    
         POPULATION:  GUARDS duck and flee as PRISONERS are flung
         about like rag-dolls by their short-circuiting BOOTS.
    
    
         INT.  ELEVATOR CORRIDOR -- NIGHT
    
         ARCHER rushes into an empty elevator.  Before he hits a
         button -- he HEARS Guards running toward him.
    
    
         INT.  CORRIDOR -- NIGHT
    
         WALTON leads his men around the corner as the elevator doors
         CLOSE.  WALTON opens fire -- riddling the doors.
    
         They pile into the adjoining stairwell -- going down.
    
         BEHIND THEM -- a narrow door clicks shut.
    
         BEHIND THE DOOR -- Archer is in a narrow fire-escape tube.
         He climbs the steel rungs of the ladder upward -- toward the
         NIGHT SKY.  The HOOT OWL leaves its perch and circles above
         -- in search of prey.
    
    
         INT.  STAIRWELL -- NIGHT
    
         Following his men down -- WALTON suddenly stops.  His eyes
         narrow with growing suspicion.
    
    
         INT.  ESCAPE TUBE -- NIGHT
    
         ARCHER is climbing, climbing -- the serene sounds of
         CRICKETS CHIRPING grow louder as the open air of the NIGHT
         SKY looms closer and closer.
    
    
         INT.  SKY ROOM -- "NIGHT"
    
         ARCHER pulls himself from the tube.
    
         But instead of FREEDOM -- he finds himself in a huge dome
         dominated by an enormous BLUE SCREEN CANOPY.
    
         THE SKY ROOM:  Designed to disorient the prisoners, hide the
         prison location and prevent escapes -- a computerizes arc-
         lamp provides simulated "Sunlight" and "Moonlight."
    
         ARCHER looks down through the sky-light into the prison
         "population area" far below -- where Guards and Prisoners
         alike scramble frantically during the alert.
    
         Suddenly Archer is jolted back to reality as SOMETHING
         swoops past his head -- the stuffed "HOOT OWL" flies by --
         attached to a cable track.  Then -- the owl EXPLODES.
    
         WALTON emerges from the escape tube -- firing.
    
         Wild SHOTS tear gaping HOLES in the "sky" -- revealing
         cables and catwalks -- chasing ARCHER out of the room.
    
    
         INT.  CORRIDOR
    
         ARCHER rushes up to a steel SECURITY DOOR.  Through its
         porthole, he can see a short ramp leading to a door marked:
    
                             EMERGENCY EXIT ONLY
                            SAFETY LINES REQUIRED
    
         ARCHER presses his thumb to the Security Door's key-pad.
         To his horror:
    
                                  SECURITY BOX
                        Print unreadable.
    
         Approaching fast:  charging footsteps and shouts.  ARCHER
         licks his thumb, tries again.  Finally:
    
                                  SECURITY BOX
                        Confirmed:  Archer, Commander
                        Jonathan T.  Please enter
                        classified security code.
    
         Archer does.  The door slides open -- Archer squeezes out.
    
    
         INT.  EXIT CORRIDOR
    
         ARCHER races straight at the door and plows right through --
    
                                                          SMASH CUT:
    
         EXT.  PRISON -- DAWN
    
         ARCHER'S blinded -- it's DAYTIME in the real world.
    
         And worse -- a GIANT WAVE crashes over Archer, knocking him
         hard on his ass.  Drenched, he grabs a guard-rail.
    
         PULL WAY, WAY BACK TO REVEAL:
    
         THE PRISON'S in the middle of the goddamn ocean, in what
         appears to be just an OIL RIG PLATFORM.  Seas are
         choppy and there's NO land in sight.
    
         Pounded by peaking waves, ARCHER struggles to his feet and
         starts climbing a ladder to the top of the PLATFORM.
    
    
         EXT.  PRISON PLATFORM -- TOP-LEVEL -- DAWN
    
         ARCHER reaches the top and peers over.  There's a row of
         helicopters:  TRANSPORTS, SUPPLY SHIPS, A GUNSHIP.
    
         ARCHER rushes to the nearest chopper -- a metal-fatigued
         supply ship -- and pauses at its landing skids.
    
         THE SKIDS ARE BOLTED TO THE DECK
    
         Instantly ARCHER goes to the LOCK-BOX on the chopper's
         tether-bolts and keys in the code "Comet."
    
         The indicator flashes RED -- no access.  He keeps trying.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Come on, Vixen ...
                        Donner ... Blixen ...
    
         Nothing.  SHOUTING.  ALARMS.  Archer keeps trying as GUARDS
         close in.  Finally -- RUDOLPH.  The tether bolts retract.
    
    
         INT./EXT.  SUPPLY SHIP -- DAWN
    
         ARCHER jumps into the cockpit and throws switches.
         Instantly the chopper whirs to life.
    
         ARCHER yanks down the pilot's canopy as BULLETS bounce off
         the bullet-resistant glass.  He draws back on the control
         stick -- too much.
    
         THE CHOPPER'S tail jerks out wildly.
    
         INSIDE -- Archer battles to regain control.  The chopper
         lifts off -- takes a sickening nose-dive over the edge of
         the platform -- and disappears.
    
         GUARDS rush to the side -- then drop to the deck in fear.
    
         THE CHOPPER spirals upward -- roaring over the platform.
    
         The GUARDS keep up their furious fusillade -- blowing chunks
         out of the supply ships' guts.
    
         TRAILING SMOKE, Archer's chopper ROARS off.  It disappears
         -- flying low over the water.
    
         ARCHER engages the RADAR CLOAK, then turns back and sees the
         receding "oil rig" vanishing in the morning mist.
    
         APPROACHING FAST -- the green Marin headlands.  Coming into
         definition -- the under-repair Golden Gate Bridge.
    
         GLANCING BACK -- Archer sees Pursuit Helicopters closing in.
         Suddenly the temp gauge starts beeping.  The wounded chopper
         is overheating -- losing its trim, breaking up fast.
    
         ARCHER steadies the controls -- trying to stabilize the
         wildly swaying craft.
    
         The Pursuit Chopper, carrying WALTON, closes in.  The
         Weapons Officer lets loose with a rocket.
    
         ARCHER'S CHOPPER -- out of control -- veers sharply.  The
         missile shoots by harmlessly.
    
                                  WALTON
                        Damn, he's good.
    
         In ARCHER'S CHOPPER, he struggles frantically to regain
         control.  But up ahead a swarm of PURSUIT CHOPPERS appear
         from the Presidio -- tightening the noose.
    
         ARCHER veers down -- beneath the Golden Gate Bridge.
         Looking for a way out, he spots --
    
         A STRING OF BUOYS dotting the Bay.  An idea.  He hauls back
         on the stick, turning the chopper 180 degrees.
    
         PURSUIT CHOPPER:  They've got Archer in their sights.
    
                                  WALTON
                        South, North, East, West.
                        You've got no where to go.
    
         But his words dry up when he sees --
    
         ARCHER'S CHOPPER -- heading straight for him.
    
         THE CHOPPERS are about to crash head-on when ...
    
         ARCHER'S CHOPPER suddenly nose-dives.  It keeps descending
         as the ocean looms closer and closer.  Then -- CRASH.
    
         SURFACE OF SAN FRANCISCO BAY:  The chopper bobs up -- next
         to the string of buoys.  Stamped on the nearest one:
         "Maintenance Bay 4 -- Prop. Bay Area Rapid Transit."
    
         The chopper slowly sinks, but Archer sits tight.
    
         THE PURSUIT CHOPPER circles above.
    
                                  WALTON
                        What's he doing?
    
         Inside ARCHER'S CHOPPER -- the water is pouring in.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        What - am - I - doing?
    
         The ocean swallows him up.
    
         UNDERWATER
    
         Archer gulps air frantically as the chopper sinks --
         seawater rushes in over his knees.
    
    
         EXT.  BAY -- DAY
    
         Divers drop from the circling pursuit choppers.
    
    
         INT.  UNDERWATER
    
         Archer's chopper settles to the murky bottom.
    
         ARCHER'S POV:  The transbay BART Tube -- and one of the
         Emergency Service Ports -- about 20 metres away.
    
         ARCHER swallows a deep breath, opens the door -- and fights
         against the sudden crush of seawater.  He squeezes out,
         tearing his shoulder on the buckled cockpit door.
    
         Blood clouds the water as ARCHER SWIMS free.  Lungs bursting,
         the swim seems endless, yet somehow he reaches the Service
         Port.  He yanks on the release handle -- it won't open.
    
         The DIVERS are coming this way.
    
         ARCHER yanks harder and WHOOSH -- the porthole dilates open.
         Archer swims up and into it.
    
    
         INT.  EMERGENCY SERVICE BAY -- DAY
    
         ARCHER pulls himself up, out of the porthole, shuts it down
         and tightens it.  He collapses -- exhausted -- until he
         hears the divers POUND -- trying to get inside.
    
         ARCHER throws open the interior door and -- BOOM!  A BART
         Train rushes by at an insane speed -- inches from his face.
         In another second -- it's gone.
    
    
         INT.  BART TUBE -- DAY
    
         ARCHER limps west.  Suddenly the tracks shake.  Archer turns
         and sees a BEAM OF LIGHT growing brighter.  A bullet train
         is roaring toward him.
    
         ARCHER looks around for a way out as the train screams in --
         right over the spot where Archer was just standing.
    
         THE CEILING:  Archer has wedged himself high up in the
         support panels.  He watches the first cars roar by -- then
         gathers his courage.  He drops down -- onto the ...
    
         ROOF OF THE TRAIN.  Archer tumbles back -- spinning out of
         control -- as he grapples for a hold on the slick surface.
         He's running out of train -- scooting headfirst onto ...
    
         THE LAST CAR.  Slipping across its length, he plunges into
         oblivion.  But his pant cuff catches on the rear wind scoop
         -- and holds fast.  Archer grabs the railing -- securing
         himself against the window.
    
         ARCHER'S POV (through window):  A woman's back.  Holding her
         infant child, she reads the paper.  The baby stares
         straight at Archer.  It reaches out to touch his funny-
         looking, squashed nose.
    
         Archer reads the paper's UPSIDE DOWN headline:
    
                           BOMB HERO LANDS NEW POST
                      Promoted to NSA's West Coast Chief
    
         And a photograph of "himself" yucking it up with Lazarro.
    
         BOOM!  The train disappears into the blackness.
    
    
         INT.  ARCHER HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- DAY
    
         EVE'S asleep.  CASTOR looks down at her like Cortez at
         Montezuma -- triumphant, with overwhelming power.
    
                                  CASTOR
                            (to himself)
                        Use it or lose it, Jon.
    
    
         EXT.  DRIVEWAY -- DAY
    
         Heading for the car, CASTOR is about to light up a smoke when --
    
                                  EVE (o.s.)
                        Last night, I thought --
                        this isn't my husband.
    
         He pockets the smoke.  EVE is there, dressed somberly.
    
                                  EVE (cont'd)
                        Obviously, I was wrong.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        What's on your mind?
    
                                  EVE
                        Jon, it's the tenth.  I
                        know how difficult it is
                        for you, but we still
                        have to go.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        I'm late.  Gotta protect and
                        serve the world, y'know.
    
                                  EVE
                        The world can wait, Jon.
                        You're going.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Okay, if you insist.
                        But -- you drive.
    
         He climbs into the front seat beside her.
    
    
         INT./EXT.  CAR -- MOVING -- DAY
    
         Beyond the suburbs -- a pastoral, hilly area.
    
                                  EVE
                        I think Jamie's been
                        seeing Karl again.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Great.
    
                                  EVE
                        Great?  He's 17 -- you told
                        her to stay away from him.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Oh, that Karl.
    
                                  EVE
                        Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        I'll have a talk with her.
                        By the way, you never said
                        anything about last night ...
    
         He moves closer, stroking her hair.  Eve starts to respond
         -- but without knowing exactly why, she tenses up.
    
                                  EVE
                        Jon -- this is hardly
                        the time or place.
    
         EVE stops the car and gets out.  CASTOR stares around in
         surprise because he sees he's in --
    
         A SPRAWLING CEMETERY
    
         CASTOR follows EVE through the ocean of headstones -- with
         no idea where she's leading him.  Then, she stops.  Castor
         joins her in front of -- A TOMBSTONE.  It reads:
    
                            Matthew Archer, Age 5
                            Beloved Son & Brother
                            We Cherish You Always
    
         Stunned, CASTOR stares as EVE places flowers on the grave.
    
                                  EVE
                        Happy birthday, Matty.
                        Every day we think of you.
                        You're part of everything
                        we are and everything we do ...
                            (breaking down)
                        I wish you could know
                        the lifetime of joy and
                        happiness you brought us.
    
         Overwhelmed with grief, she collapses into CASTOR.
    
                                  EVE (cont'd)
                        He took our baby, Jon.
                        He took our little boy.
    
         FULL SCREEN -- CASTOR'S FACE
    
         He stares at the grave of the boy he killed -- the boy whose
         mother is weeping into his chest.
    
         Shutting his eyes to the grave, CASTOR stiffly returns EVE'S
         embrace -- maybe, just maybe, feeling the victim's pain.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Stop crying ... stop
                        crying ... stop ...
    
    
         EXT.  NSA HQ -- DAY
    
         Shrugging off his funk, CASTOR whistles his way inside.
    
    
         INT.  NSA "DEBRIEFING" AREA -- DAY
    
         A vigilant NSA agent stands watch outside a glass-enclosed
         booth.  INSIDE, Pollux is working at a computer.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        How's our star witness?
    
                                  AGENT
                        Spilling his guts.  Obviously
                        his guilty conscience has
                        finally caught up with him.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Obviously.
    
         Castor dismisses the agent and enters THE BOOTH.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        Don't get mad, but I just
                        went for a little stroll
                        through the company switches.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        You're supposed to be snitching,
                        making me look legit.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        Don't worry, nobody knows I'm
                        inside.  Check it out.  Remember
                        that fat fuck agent who roughed
                        us up in Thailand?  He's being
                        treated for bone cancer at the

                        -- Ooops!  His radiation does
                        just quadrupled.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Are you TRYING to give us away?
                        For somebody with such a big
                        brain, you think awfully small.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        I'm just having some fun.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        There's fun, bro.  Then
                        there's FUN.
    
    
         INT.  WAREHOUSE -- DAY
    
         An enormous warehouse stocked with weapons and equipment.
         POLLUX picks through the technical hardware ... WE SEE each
         weapon as he sings like a kid on Christmas morn.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        Eight pocket stingers ...
                        seven piper uzis ... six
                        cobra carbines ...
                            (aims at Castor)
                        five - net - launch-ers ...
    
                                  CASTOR
                            (grabs weapon away)
                        Yeah -- it's Santa's Magic
                        fucking Village.  Your
                        present's in here.
    
         CASTOR unlocks a door marked "EVIDENCE STORAGE."
    
    
         INT.  EVIDENCE STORAGE -- DAY
    
         CASTOR leads POLLUX down corridor after corridor of
         confiscated weapons, drugs, contraband.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        As the new chief of covert
                        operations, I've planned a
                        little get-together with
                        the Pacific Rim station
                        chiefs.  Friday night.
    
         CASTOR finds a locker, checks the number, then opens it up.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        And when they "get-together"
                        -- what happens?
    
         Castor reveals POLLUX'S BOMB and other confiscated
         paraphenalia.  Pollux gasps, thrilled.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        We gut the organization --
                        and rebuild it with more
                        reliable friends.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        Most of the current chiefs
                        -- they must have pretty
                        hefty prices on their heads.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        All of them do.  We'll
                        kill twelve birds with one
                        bomb.  And we'll be rich.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        Good, because I checked your
                        salary -- and it bites.  How
                        the everyday working-class stiff
                        survives in today's economy is
                        something I'll never ...
    
         Castor shuts up Pollux by tossing him a small steel
         cylinder.  Inside it is a vacuum-sealed culture tube.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        You'll need to recultivate
                        that virus.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        No problem.
    
                                  WANDA (o.s.)
                        Commander!
    
    
         INT.  ARMORY -- DAY
    
         CASTOR emerges from Evidence Storage and finds his team.
    
                                  WANDA
                        You picked a helluva day
                        to leave your beeper off!
    
                                  CASTOR
                        What happened?
    
                                  WANDA
                        Castor's escaped!
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Escaped?  From Erewhon?
                            (staggered)
                        I want everyone on this
                        -- our entire force and
                        the SFPD.
    
                                  BUZZ
                        SFPD?  Castor isn't stupid
                        enough to come back to the city.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Trust me, he's already here.
                        Get going!
    
         Wanda and Buzz run off.  Pollux emerges;  he's heard.
    
                                  CASTOR (cont'd)
                        Have the twins watch my
                        "wife."  He'll try
                        to get to her.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        What about me?
    
                                  CASTOR
                        A lot of people think you're
                        a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
    
                                  POLLUX
                        Like I fucking care?  I'm
                        not just sitting here!
    
         Determined, Pollux heads for the door.  Castor stops him.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Take my Glock.  It's
                        a jungle out there.
    
         CASTOR slaps his weapon in his brother's palm -- Castor's
         gesture of filial love.  Pollux takes it -- touched.
    
    
         EXT.  GOLDEN GATE PARK -- PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT
    
         Archer punches a button.  A GASH on his injured shoulder
         bleeds through his tattered clothes.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Collect call to Evelyn
                        Archer at 392-0888.
    
                                  OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        Who's placing the call, please?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        -- Her husband.
    
         Archer waits.  He pinches his throat -- trying to somehow
         dislodge the vocal implant micro-chip.  His voice scrambles
         into garbled static -- then reverts back to Castor's voice.
    
                                  ARCHER (cont'd)
                        Goddamn it.
    
    
         INT.  HOSPITAL -- NIGHT
    
         EVE is in scrubs, dissecting a cadaver's skull with a
         handheld LASER BONE-SAW.  Other students watch the procedure
         -- along with their dour PROCTOR.
    
                                  EVE
                        Jon?  Hello?
    
    
         INT.  PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT
    
         ARCHER listens longingly.  Just hearing her voice ...
    
                                  EVE
                        Is someone there?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Eve, listen carefully.
                            (a beat)
                        The man you think is
                        your husband -- isn't.
    
    
         INT/EXT.  SILVER SAAB -- NIGHT
    
         LARS and LUNT are parked outside the hospital.  They're
         huddled over their surveillance equipment -- listening.
    
                                  LARS
                            (starts car)
                        -- Got him.
    
    
         INT.  HOSPITAL -- NIGHT
    
         EVE is confused, distracted.  The Proctor waits impatiently,
         grading pad in hand.
    
                                  EVE
                        Who is this?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Never mind that!  Just
                        take Jamie and get out
                        of that house.  Don't
                        tell anyone where you're
                        going -- especially not
                        him -- just GO.
    
                                  EVE
                        Okay, you're having an
                        emotional crisis.  You
                        need to seek the help
                        of a trained --
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Think about it, Eve!
                        Everything he's done
                        recently has been
                        peculiar, right?  He's
                        said and done things your
                        husband would never do ...
    
                                  EVE
                        Whoever you are, don't
                        call again.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Don't hang up ...
    
         She clicks off.  Disturbed, she's forgotten where she is.
    
                                  PROCTOR
                        Doctor, we're waiting ...
    
         Eve shakes off her instinctive chill and goes back to work
         -- SPLITTING the cadaver's cranium with the laser.
    
    
         EXT.  PARK -- NIGHT
    
         ARCHER sags in futility.  But a SECOND CLICK on the phone
         line makes him snap alert.  Was that a phone tap?
    
         Suspicious, ARCHER dashes out.  He scans the parking lot --
         several cars and a pick-up truck plastered with Playboy
         centerfolds.  Then Archer sees ...
    
         IN THE DISTANCE -- car HEADLIGHTS speeding toward the park.
    
         Only the truck is unlocked.  ARCHER slips in and starts to
         hot-wire it.  The engine grinds and chokes.
    
         THE SAAB reaches the edge of the park.
    
         ARCHER finally starts up the truck.  He finds a cowboy hat
         on the seat and shoves it on his head as he drives away ...
    
         THE TRUCK exits the far end of the parking lot and rounds
         the bend ... just as the Saab arrives.
    
         LARS and LUNT leap out and scan around.  Archer is gone.
    
    
         EXT.  TITO'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
    
         Sagging yellow CRIME-SCENE TAPE seals off the door.
    
         ACROSS THE STREET:  Archer watches from the truck.  His face
         reflects the nightmarish truth:  Tito is dead.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        No, Jon ... think like Castor.
                        Where would he go ... who
                        would he turn to?
    
    
         EXT.  STRIP MALL -- NIGHT
    
         SASHA PLUMMER exits a beauty shop.  She's a hardened, but
         sensual woman.  She gets in her old Lexus and takes off.
    
    
         INT.  LEXUS -- MOVING -- NIGHT
    
         She slows down to check out a POLICE FORENSICS TEAM that's
         swarming all over Archer's abandoned pick-up truck.
    
                                  SASHA
                        Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Yeah -- me.
    
         In a flash, SASHA grabs some pepper-spray.  ARCHER --
         hunkered down in the back-seat -- stares into the nozzle.
    
                                  SASHA
                        Jesus Christ, Castor.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Drive.
    
                                  SASHA
                        The last time I took orders
                        from you I ended up with
                        five years probation.
    
         She stops the car -- mere yards from the milling police.
         One VETERAN COP looks her way -- scrutinizing.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Just get out of here --
                        please.  I -- I'll ...
    
         ARCHER'S losing consciousness.  SASHA looks at him harshly
         -- like a woman trying to hate someone she still loves.
         Then, she sees the blood seeping through his shirt.
    
                                  SASHA
                        Damn it, Caz.
    
         She hits the gas and drives off.
    
    
         INT.  ARCHER'S HOME OFFICE -- NIGHT
    
         CASTOR'S on the phone as he scrolls through CD-ROM files.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        -- you don't have to rat out
                        anybody ... nothing changes
                        except now you've got the
                        blessing -- and protection --
                        of the NSA ...
                            (now in Spanish)
                        [No.  Santiago's spoken for
                        ... you can have Panama City
                        or Acapulco.  Take Acapulco,
                        the food's better.]
    
         Something catches Castor's attention.  He sees --
    
         DOWN ON THE STREET
    
         A jet-black Firebird SCREECHES up to the curb.
    
                                  CASTOR (cont'd)
                        Bueno ... I'll be in touch.
    
         He hangs up and watches the Firebird.  The thumping MUSIC
         from within goes quiet, but no one emerges.
    
    
         INT.  FIREBIRD -- NIGHT
    
         JAMIE is inside, struggling with big, amorous KARL (17).
    
                                  JAMIE
                        No ... no, please.
                            (he doesn't stop)
                        My father -- he's got a
                        gun -- he'll -- he'll --
    
                                  KARL
                        That wimp won't do shit.
                            (pulls open belt)
                        Anyway, you said he's
                        never home --
    
         SMASH!  The window explodes inward.  CASTOR drags KARL out
         by his hair.  JAMIE scrambles toward the house as ...
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Who are you to call
                        Jon Archer a wimp?
    
         Karl stammers, terrified.  Enraged, CASTOR pulls Karl
         eyeball-to-eyeball -- the kid goes white with fear.
    
                                  CASTOR (cont'd)
                        You dickless suburban puke,
                        get out of here before I
                        eat your fucking spleen.
    
         CASTOR heaves Karl into the windshield -- spiderwebbing it.
         Somehow the kid finds his feet and stumbles behind the
         wheel.  The Firebird lurches away.
    
    
         INT.  HOUSE -- NIGHT
    
         CASTOR enters to find JAMIE, still shaken up.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        What are you -- stupid?
    
                                  JAMIE
                        You haven't changed at all!
                        Some guy tries to rape me
                        -- and you side with him!
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Did it look like I was
                        siding with him?  Did it?
                            (she falls silent)
                        You want to play with
                        the bad boys, you
                        better be prepared.  Do
                        you have protection?
    
                                  JAMIE
                        You mean like ... condoms?
    
                                  CASTOR
                        I mean like protection.
    
         With a fluid motion, CASTOR expertly snaps open a well-
         oiled BUTTERFLY KNIFE and hands it to an astonished Jamie.
    
                                  JAMIE
                        For me?
    
         Castor's surprised, flustered as Jamie tearfully hugs him.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        -- Now, uh, brush your
                        bed and go to teeth --
                        it's a school night.
    
         JAMIE kisses him and heads up stairs.  After she's gone ...
    
                                  CASTOR (cont'd)
                        Jesus, Jon, how did you
                        deal with this family shit?
    
         The phone RINGS.  He rushes to the den and picks it up.
    
                                  CASTOR (cont'd)
                        Jon Archer.
                            (immediately alert)
                        Where is he?
    
    
         EXT.  STREET -- NIGHT
    
         POLLUX TROY is half-hidden in the shadows, peering into an
         underground parking structure.
    
                                  POLLUX
                            (into cellular)
                        -- Some condo complex on
                        Telegraph Hill.  I played
                        a hunch he might contact
                        an old friend of yours ...
    
         POLLUX'S P.O.V. -- THE GARAGE
    
         SASHA helps a half-conscious ARCHER toward the elevator.
    
    
         EXT.  NSA MARSHALING AREA -- NIGHT
    
         Dressed and armed for battle, the NSA assault team is
         loading into a variety of waiting vehicles.
    
         CASTOR arrives, dressed in standard-issue black squad suit
         and flak vest.  BUZZ tosses CASTOR a machine-pistol as he
         climbs aboard the lead vehicle.  The convoy moves out.
    
    
         INT.  SASHA'S CONDO -- NIGHT
    
         ARCHER'S eyes open ... he snaps awake.  SASHA is stitching
         up his cleaned wound.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Where am I?
    
                                  SASHA
                        My place.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        You shouldn't have brought
                        me here ... it's dangerous.
    
                                  SASHA
                        Better than you bleeding
                        all over my car upholstery.
                        Trust me, Caz, you won't
                        be here long.
    
         With a flourish of her extravagant nails, Sasha finishes up
         the stitches -- a passable sewing job.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        I hear you're a manicurist
                        now -- got your own business
                        and everything.  I'm glad
                        you've stayed clean.
    
                                  SASHA
                        Like I had a choice with
                        that anal-retentive Jon
                        Archer rising my ass at
                        the probation hearing.
                            (shrugs)
                        At least he took an interest.
                        You took off without leaving
                        so much as a Post-it.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        I'm not the same person
                        you remember.
    
         She studies him with her sharp, intelligent eyes -- eyes
         which soften dramatically as she smiles for the first time.
    
                                  SASHA
                        Take the rest of those
                        filthy things off.
                        I'll be right back.
    
         SASHA disappears into a back bedroom.  ARCHER looks out the
         window -- the street's clear.  He sits down, unties his
         trash-dumpster shoes.  He touches his shoulder -- it hurts.
    
                                  SASHA (cont'd)
                            (entering)
                        You're still dressed.
    
         She puts down a pile of men's clothes and starts to loosen
         his belt.  She stares deep in his eyes.
    
                                  SASHA (cont'd)
                        You really have changed,
                        haven't you?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        More than you'll ever know.
    
         Gently, tenderly, she moves closer and kisses him on the
         mouth.  She lingers as Archer carefully pulls away.
    
                                  ARCHER (cont'd)
                        -- Can we just talk?
    
                                  SASHA
                            (amused)
                        Talk?  The only talk I ever
                        heard from you was "take
                        it off," "sit on it," "I'll
                        see you around."
    
         He backs off -- as something catches his eye.  A sleepy
         LITTLE BOY (5) is standing in the bedroom doorway.  He
         watches curiously as Archer buttons up a fresh shirt.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Perfect fit.
    
                                  SASHA
                        Should be.  It's yours.
    
         Awkward silence as Archer dresses.  The boy comes over
         shyly, climbs into Sasha's lap.  Archer's self-conscious.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Nice-looking kid.
    
                                  SASHA
                        Of course he is ...
                            (very uneasy)
                        -- He's yours too.
    
    
         EXT.  SASHA'S CONDO -- NIGHT
    
         Their SILHOUETTES are visible against the shades.  Suddenly
         a TETHERED SURVEILLANCE DRONE whirs up to the second-story
         window -- scanning the building.
    
    
         EXT.  ROOFTOP ACROSS -- NIGHT
    
         CASTOR, BUZZ, WANDA and LOOMIS peer at the drone's THERMAL-
         VIDEO FEED of the silhouettes in Sasha's apartment.
    
                                  CASTOR
                            (into cellular)
                        We've got him sighted.
                        Okay, Pollux, pull out.
    
                                  BUZZ
                        What makes you so sure
                        this guy's gonna set up
                        his own brother?
    
                                  CASTOR
                        I've never been more
                        certain of anything.
                        Get everyone in position.
                        -- And get the word
                        out -- shoot to kill.
    
         Buzz starts to object -- but Castor's steely eyes say
         "don't argue -- that's an order."
    
                                  BUZZ
                        You heard the Commander
                        -- let's saddle up!
    
         Buzz and Wanda move off -- leaving Loomis with Castor.
    
    
         INT.  SASHA'S CONDO -- NIGHT
    
         SASHA leads the shy boy to his "father."  Archer's stunned.
    
                                  SASHA
                        Go on, Adam ...
                            (a beat)
                        I'm not asking you for
                        anything -- I was never
                        even going to tell you.
                        But hell, I never thought
                        I'd see you again, either.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        How old is he?
    
                                  SASHA
                        Five.  No one knows you're
                        his father.  I thought
                        someone might want to hurt
                        him -- just to hurt you.
    
         Archer's emotions take him to a darker place.  Hands
         shaking, he holds the boy, perhaps a bit too roughly.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Yes ... someone might want
                        to tear him apart -- snuff
                        him out -- for revenge.
    
                                  SASHA
                        You're not holding him
                        right ... Caz ...
    
         ARCHER isn't hearing SASHA.  He's lost in his own MEMORY ...
         a SQUEAL of tires ... Castor FIRING ... glass SHATTERING ...
         a child's fading CRIES.  He's RELIVING his own son's death.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        In one awful moment
                        -- he could be dead.
    
         ARCHER'S grip tightens around Adam -- his big hands
         dwarfing the little boy's body.
    
         ADAM looks straight at Archer with a child's eyes.  Big,
         naive -- innocent.  It pulls something up from inside
         Archer ... something STRONG.
    
         He regains control, dumping the child into Sasha's arms.
    
                                  ARCHER (cont'd)
                        He's not my son.
    
                                  SASHA
                        Yes, he is.  Caz --
    
         SOMETHING alerts Archer -- maybe the fleeting SHADOWS that
         blot out the window-light for the barest second.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Get down!  GET DOWN!
    
         K-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM!  The window panes shatter -- as TEAR
         GAS GRENADES and GUNFIRE riddles the room.
    
         OUTSIDE
    
         On the rooftop across the way, CASTOR directs the firepower.
    
         INSIDE
    
         Coughing, ARCHER crawls through the roiling smoke toward the
         door.  He's almost out when ...
    
         ADAM'S WAIL of fear freezes Archer.  He looks back -- and
         sees Sasha.  She's knocked-out.
    
         ADAM stands beside her -- frantically pulling on her limp arm.
    
         ARCHER'S face betrays his conflict.  A child -- but his
         worst enemy's child.  He watches as --
    
         BULLETS shred the wall around Adam.  The boy's frozen.
    
         ARCHER moves -- he crawls toward Sasha and Adam, grabs them
         and pulls them out into --
    
         THE HALLWAY.  Archer hauls them down the corridor as the
         walls disintegrate behind them.
    
    
         EXT.  STREET -- NIGHT
    
         CASTOR and his Team race toward the smoke-filled building.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Split up.  I want to know
                        the second he's spotted.
    
    
         INT.  CONDO COMPLEX -- CORRIDOR -- NIGHT
    
         Momentarily safe, Archer rouses Sasha.  She comes to and
         hugs Adam, making sure he's okay.
    
                                  SASHA
                        Thank you, Caz ...
    
         BOOT STEPS and SHOUTING VOICES.  ARCHER takes off.
    
    
         INT.  STAIRWELL -- NIGHT
    
         ARCHER rushes through the roiling tear-gas -- and stops short.
    
         CASTOR is there.  He raises his machine-gun -- too late.
    
         ARCHER leaps -- slamming into Castor.  FACE-TO-FACE -- they
         slug it out, bashing and butting.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Stay away from my family!
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Too late, your kid worships
                        me.  And your wife -- she's
                        an animal.  Even I can't
                        keep up with her.
    
         Enraged, ARCHER heaves CASTOR -- he plunges down the stairs,
         head-over-heels, and lands in a heap.  LOOMIS arrives,
         firing, driving Archer back up the stairs -- toward the roof.
    
    
         EXT.  ROOFTOP -- NIGHT
    
         ARCHER runs along the length of the roof to the opposite
         fire-escape railing.  But as he turns ... he finds himself
         looking right into the barrel of POLLUX'S PISTOL.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        Peek-a-boo, dumb fuck.
    
         Pollux KICKS Archer hard -- Archer slips down on the guard
         rail -- but manages to hold on by his fingers.
    
                                  POLLUX (cont'd)
                        Remember me?  Your
                        big brother?
    
         Pollux steps down -- grinding Archer's fingers into the
         steel fire-escape rung.
    
         BELOW:  CASTOR and LOOMIS race over.  Loomis aims his
         machine-pistol -- but Castor stops him.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Wait for a better shot.
    
         ON THE ROOF:  Pollux puts his full weight down on Archer's
         hand.  In agony, Archer sees his one chance --
    
         THE RUSTED RIVETS that fix the fire-escape to the brick
         wall.  ARCHER plants his feet on the wall and pushes as
         Pollux cocks his pistol -- aiming right at ARCHER'S head.
    
                                  POLLUX
                        You tricked me into telling
                        you shit I never told anyone.
                        Now take it to your grave.
    
         THE RIVETS strain -- then give.  With a shriek, the fire-
         escape pulls away.  Pollux loses his balance --
    
         POLLUX PLUNGES three stories and pancakes onto the street.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Pollux ... Pollux!
    
         POLLUX is almost gone.  CASTOR looks up and sees --
    
         ARCHER -- scrambling over the ledge onto the roof.
    
         EYE-CONTACT between predator and prey, killer and cop.
    
         CASTOR opens fire --
    
         ARCHER ducks the bullets as he disappears over the lip.
    
    
         EXT.  ROOFTOP -- NIGHT
    
         ARCHER catches his breath -- then SEES something.  It's the
         small, steel CYLINDER Pollux took from NSA Evidence.
    
    
         EXT.  STREET -- NIGHT
    
         CASTOR desperately performs CPR on Pollux -- to no avail.
         POLLUX slips away ... and dies.
    
                                  CASTOR
                            (to Loomis)
                        Get a medic -- now!
                        Hang on, Pollux ...
    
                                  LOOMIS
                        Forget him, sir.  It's
                        only Pollux Troy ...
    
         Castor snaps.  Without hesitation, he jerks up his gun and
         puts a bullet right in the middle of Loomis's head.
    
         CASTOR looks at the dead kid -- his rage barely abated as --
         BUZZ and WANDA arrive on the scene and see Loomis's body.
    
                                  WANDA
                        What happened?
    
                                  CASTOR
                        What the fuck do you
                        think happened?  Castor
                        Troy just shot him!
                            (a beat)
                        What are you waiting
                        for?  GO!
    
         After Buzz and Wanda take off -- CASTOR gathers Pollux up in
         his arms -- totally devastated.
    
    
         INT.  MARINA -- DRY DOCKED FREIGHTER -- DAY
    
         The old ship's hold has been converted into a laboratory.
         At a work table, a sealed ISOLATION TANK is filled with
         healthy RATS ... one-by-one, they convulse, then drop dead.
    
                                  DIETRICH (o.s.)
                        Mother nature at her finest.
                        One part per trillion of this
                        stuff will kill you faster
                        than a mailman with a grudge.
    
         PULL BACK to reveal ARCHER with DIETRICH HASSLER (45) -- an
         illicit chemist recognizable from Castor's dossier.
    
         He holds up the steel TUBE Archer found on the roof.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        And this thing can grow it?
    
                                  DIETRICH
                        Yes.  Pollux bought one
                        along with the original
                        batch.  Obviously, he
                        found a way to make more.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Why would he need more?
    
                                  DIETRICH
                        He's your brother, you
                        figure it out.  Maybe he
                        made another bomb.
    
                                  ARCHER
                            (realizes)
                        Or reactivated the first one.
    
                                  DIETRICH
                        Right ... like Jon Archer
                        would ever let that happen.
    
    
         INT.  ARCHER'S NSA OFFICE -- DAY
    
         CASTOR is alone -- staring blankly at POLLUX'S image on his
         computer monitor.  Ironically, he has been encoded as
         "Castor's" latest victim.  LAZARRO pops her head in the door.
    
                                  LAZARRO
                        I just heard about Castor's
                        fratricide -- rather poetic,
                        don't you think?
    
                                  CASTOR
                        What is it, Admiral?
                        I'm under the gun here.
    
                                  LAZARRO
                        I just thought that --
                        under the circumstances
                        -- you might want to
                        postpone the meeting
                        with the station chiefs.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        No.  Most of them are in
                        transit by now.  I'm heading
                        over to the hotel to
                        personally oversee security.
    
                                  LAZARRO
                        Okay, then.  I leave
                        it in your able hands.
    
         Lazarro exits.  CASTOR picks up the framed photo of EVE and
         JAMIE -- staring at it with unbridled hatred.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        My able hands.
    
         Fury rising, he crumples the frame -- and the photo -- in
         his clenching grip.  He hurls it, choking back his rage.
    
    
         EXT.  NEW ST. MARKS -- DAY (ESTABLISHING)
    
         A tower with a dramatic REVOLVING RESTAURANT on its roof.
    
    
         INT.  SERVICE ROOM -- DAY
    
         CASTOR wires the BIO-BOMB into the climate control system.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        For you, bro.
    
         He hits the ACTIVATION switch.  The bomb WHIRS to life.
    
    
         INT.  CAR WASH -- DAY
    
         Two SFPD COPS watch from the PICTURE-WINDOW as their car is
         pulled through.  It disappears into SOAP CYCLE.
    
         SOAP sprays everywhere -- coating the observation windows,
         obscuring the Cops' view of their car.
    
                                  COP
                        Crap, I wanted hot wax.
    
         The soap ceases.  The Cops gawk -- their car is GONE.
    
    
         EXT.  COP CAR -- MOVING -- DAY
    
         The squad car's windshield wipers whisk away the beaded
         water -- revealing ARCHER behind the wheel.
    
         INSIDE
    
         ARCHER hits a switch -- the car's tinted windows DARKEN
         automatically, obscuring him from the outside.
    
    
         EXT.  STREET -- DAY
    
         ARCHER slows the squad car.
    
         UP AHEAD:  Parked cop cars block both lanes of the main road
         -- a ROAD-BLOCK check-point for all traffic.
    
         ARCHER pulls off the road, out of sight.  He flips open the
         portacomp and starts to type rapidly.
    
         ON SCREEN -- the computer registers a PRIORITY ALERT from
         Commander Jon Archer.
    
    
         INT.  NSA -- DAY
    
         A Dispatcher's SCANNER clicks to life.
    
                                  DISPATCHER
                        All units.  I have a confirmed
                        code zero-zero priority alert.
                        Proceed at once to Army Street
                        Terminal.  That's Army at Third.
    
         QUICK SHOTS:
    
         NSA MOTORPOOL -- TAC SQUADS pile into armored jeeps.
         HELIPORT -- CHOPPERS lift off and veer east.
         ARCHER'S HOUSE -- The surveillance cars roar away.
    
    
         EXT.  ROADBLOCK -- DAY
    
         ARCHER watches as the checkpoint of COP CARS pulls apart and
         screams east on the main road -- passing Archer.  Once the
         armada is gone, he pulls out and heads west.
    
    
         INT.  NSA -- DAY
    
         CASTOR arrives.  He bumps into Wanda -- she's shocked.
    
                                  WANDA
                        Commander, what are you
                        doing here?
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Where should I be?
                            (looks around)
                        Where's everyone else?
    
                                  WANDA
                        Backing you up!  Didn't
                        you track Castor to the
                        Army Street Terminal?
    
                                  CASTOR
                        What?
    
                                  WANDA
                        It was confirmed by your
                        personal security code.
                        Nobody knows that code
                        but you!
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Obviously someone else
                        knows it!  Get everybody
                        back to their posts -- NOW!
    
    
         INT.  ARCHER HOME -- SUNSET
    
         ARCHER tiptoes through the house -- listening.  He hears
         WATER RUNNING upstairs.
    
         MASTER BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS
    
         ARCHER walks in and steps toward the bathroom -- passing the
         bed.  He stops.  On top of the rumpled covers:  Eve's
         nightgown and a pair of Castor's black mesh briefs.
    
         Overwhelmed, he sits down -- not noticing the water has
         stopped.  Eve steps in from the bathroom.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Eve ...
    
         The look of horror on her face snaps him back to reality.
         She runs, but Archer grabs her.  She struggles -- fighting
         and kicking him -- but somehow he keeps her mouth covered.
    
                                  ARCHER (cont'd)
                        I'm not going to hurt you.
                        Just don't scream, okay?
                            (no response)
                        Okay?
    
         She finally nods and he eases off her.  Her face betrays her
         utter fear -- and her building anger.
    
                                  EVE
                        I know you -- you're the
                        one who called.  You're
                        Castor Troy.  You killed
                        my son --
    
                                  ARCHER
                        -- I called, but I'm not
                        Castor.  I'm your husband.
    
         ARCHER holds onto her as she struggles again.
    
                                  ARCHER (cont'd)
                        This time you're going
                        to listen.  Last week --
                        we were in bed -- we had a
                        fight after you touched my scar.
                        I told you I had to go away.
                            (a beat)
                        My assignment -- Jon
                        Archer's assignment --
                        was to enter a federal
                        prison as Castor Troy.
    
         EVE is startled by this intimate information but she reveals
         nothing.  SIRENS approach the house, the cops are returning.
         She keeps an eye on the door.  Playing for time.
    
                                  EVE
                        How did he expect to
                        do that?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        An NSA surgeon gave me
                        Castor's face.  He handled the
                        transplant, the vocal implant,
                        everything.  But somehow
                        Castor came out of his coma
                        -- and killed everyone who
                        knew about the mission.
                        But not before he was
                        transformed into me.
    
         The front DOOR clicks open.  A voice booms out.
    
                                  COPS (o.s.)
                        Dr. Archer, are you okay?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        If you need hard evidence,
                        get it.  Your husband's
                        blood type is O negative.
                        Castor's is AB.
    
         Archer glances at the balcony -- but doesn't budge as
         FOOTSTEPS clomp up the stairs.  Eve is about to answer -- or
         scream.  But then ...
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Remember the parachute
                        dream?  I'm falling, Eve,
                        and I need your help ...
    
         The blood drains from her face as ... ARCHER slips over the
         balcony and disappears.
    
    
         INT.  ARCHER HOME OFFICE -- LATER -- NIGHT
    
         EVE pauses at the door and peers in.
    
         IT'S A MESS ... legal pads, cappuccino cups with cigarette
         butts, diskettes marked NSA CLASSIFIED scattered everywhere.
         Funny, the office never looked this disorganized.  Ever.
    
         Eve sifts through the paperwork.  Finds a legal pad with
         with NUMBERS in dollars corresponding to abbreviations:
         HCMC ... N ... HK ... SD.
    
    
         EXT.  ARCHER HOME -- NIGHT
    
         CASTOR pulls up, tiredly smoking a cigarette.  Sees Cops
         hanging around, keeping watch.  Notices something.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Hey -- keep off the lawn.
    
         INTERCUT:  CASTOR AND EVE
    
         EVE is at the computer work-station, scrolling through
         NSA organizational schematics ... charts & graphs ... dry
         bureaucratic verbiage ... gibberish to her.
    
         Frustrated, she hits Escape ... the system resets to PROGRAM
         MANAGER.  And suddenly -- a connection.
    
         THE SCREEN has reset to its SUB-DIRECTORIES:  Ho Chi Minh
         City ... Nandi ... Acapulco ... Santiago.  12 in all.
    
         STAIRCASE:  CASTOR trudges upstairs.
    
         EVE at the work-station.  Concentrating.  Oblivious.
    
         CASTOR peers in the bedroom -- nobody there.
    
         EVE looks up.  Did she hear something?
    
         CASTOR hustles down the hall and pushes open the office
         door.  On edge, he draws his pistol.  His hand touches the
         door knob as ...
    
         EVE concentrates on the computer.  Suddenly, CASTOR is there.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        What are you doing?
    
                                  EVE
                        -- Studying.
    
         Suspicious, Castor swivels around the monitor -- and sees a
         hi-definition CD-ROM of the human vascular system.
    
                                  EVE (cont'd)
                        You scared me half to death.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Baby, I'm working on some
                        very sensitive documents
                        here.  If you don't mind
                        -- use the laptop.
    
         Eve silently assents, quickly heading for the door, but
         Castor stops her.
    
                                  CASTOR (cont'd)
                        What's wrong?
    
                                  EVE
                        Nothing.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        I disagree.
                            (a beat)
                        You think I've been acting
                        strange.  Like a completely
                        different person.
    
                                  EVE
                        -- Yes.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Okay, I have a confession
                        to make.  But you aren't
                        going to like it.
    
         CASTOR wraps his hands dangerously around her slender neck.
    
                                  CASTOR (cont'd)
                        I read your diary.  I've
                        been trying to change
                        -- I'm trying to be the
                        man you want me to be.
    
         EVE reacts to the explanation.  There is a logic to it.
    
                                  CASTOR (cont'd)
                        You forgive me, don't you?
    
                                  EVE
                        -- Of course I do.
    
    
         INT.  ARCHER'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
    
         Castor and Eve slumber peacefully.  Then -- EVE'S EYES
         slowly open.  Quietly, she turns and spoons into Castor.
    
         Eve starts rubbing his shoulders.  Castor responds but doesn't
         wake as EVE'S FIST opens up -- revealing a tiny LANCET.
    
         With frightened eyes, she presses the needle to his flesh,
         about to sink it -- but he stirs.  She kisses him tenderly
         as he falls back asleep.
    
         Eve takes a deep breath and carefully pricks Castor --
         DRAWING BLOOD.  An instant later -- the lancet is out.
    
    
         INT.  HOSPITAL -- NIGHT
    
         Nothing happening here at 4 AM.  Nothing indeed.
    
    
         INT.  HOSPITAL -- LAB -- NIGHT
    
         EVE paces anxiously as the blood-analyzer clicks away.
    
                                  EVE
                        Please be O-neg.  Please ...
    
         The machine stops clicking.  It reads MALE -- TYPE AB.  She
         buries her face in her hands -- completely stunned.
    
                                  ARCHER (o.s.)
                        Thanks for believing me.
    
         ARCHER emerges from the darkness of her office -- but EVE
         pulls a pistol -- aiming it with calm authority.
    
                                  ARCHER (cont'd)
                        What are you doing?  Where
                        did you get that gun?
    
                                  EVE
                        I took it from my fake husband.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Why point it at me?  I'm
                        the real thing.
    
                                  EVE
                        I don't know that.  Maybe
                        Jon's already dead.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        What more proof do you need?
    
                                  EVE
                        Tell me what happened on
                        April 9th -- 13 years ago.
    
         Archer looks blank.  April 9th?  13 years ago?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        It was my first real date ...
                        I borrowed my dad's car and
                        took her out for ribs -- not
                        knowing she was a vegan.
                        To make it worse, she broke
                        her tooth on a pebble that
                        somehow got into her salad
                        -- and we drove around all
                        night, looking for a dentist.
                        I thought the date was a total
                        botch -- but she kissed me.
                        Even though it must have hurt --
                        she leaned over, ice-pack on her
                        cheek, and kissed me goodnight.
                            (smiles)
                        She still has that pebble
                        in the top drawer of her
                        jewelry box.  And I think
                        it still hurts her sometimes
                        -- to kiss me.
    
         EVE looks into his eyes -- searching beyond their color.
         Then she puts the gun down, fighting off tears.
    
                                  EVE
                        Christ, Jon!  How could
                        you do this to yourself?
                        How could you do this to us?
                            (quietly)
                        Do you know -- do you know
                        what he did to me ...?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Whatever happened, whatever
                        he did -- I know it's my
                        fault and I know I can never
                        make it up to you --
    
         She pulls herself together -- regaining her composure.
    
                                  EVE
                        But you're damn well
                        going to try.
    
    
         INT.  EVE'S OFFICE -- LATER -- NIGHT
    
         Eve clicks on the light, then produces some xeroxed
         documents.  Archer quickly scrutinizes them.
    
                                  EVE
                        He freaked out when he
                        thought I had seen this
                        stuff.  I think it's a
                        list of cities -- Santiago,
                        Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Our Pacific Rim stations.
                        These numbers must be bounties.
                        Castor's not wasting any time.
    
                                  EVE
                        What do you mean?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        He's going to kill off our
                        bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
    
                                  EVE
                        -- Or maybe all at once.
                            (off his reaction)
                        There's a get-together
                        tonight at New St. Marks.
                        For all the bureau chiefs
                        and their families.  He's
                        insisted Jamie and I be
                        there too.
    
         A sinking feeling hits Archer.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        You can't go.  You can't be
                        anywhere near that place.
    
                                  EVE
                        Jon, what is it?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        The bomb.  He's reactivated
                        it.  And everyone there is
                        going to die.
    
                                  EVE
                        Can't we call someone?
                        Admiral Lazarro?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        I know Lazarro -- the first
                        person she'd call is "me."
                        We can't take the chance of
                        tipping Castor off.
    
                                  EVE
                        Jon, if I'm not there, he
                        will be tipped off.  I'll
                        get rid of Jamie -- but you
                        and I are in this together.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Eve ...
    
         She kisses the face of the man who killed her son -- now her
         husband's face.  She is resolute.
    
                                  EVE
                        Now -- what do we do?
    
    
         INT.  ARCHER HOME -- MORNING
    
         Castor comes downstairs, rubbing his "stung" shoulder.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Where's my wife?
    
                                  LARS
                        She went to the hospital
                        last night -- she was on
                        call.  Didn't you know?
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Find her -- and watch
                        her like a hawk.
    
    
         EXT.  NEW ST. MARKS HOTEL -- ENTRANCE AREA -- DAY
    
         Business as usual -- except for the SFPD and the NSA
         SECURITY TEAM keeping a discreet watch.
    
         PULL BACK:  ACROSS THE STREET
    
         ARCHER checks out the NSA Security Team;  there's no way
         he's getting in there.  Then he sees --
    
         DELIVERY TRUCKS turning down the ramp beneath the hotel --
         into the basement loading dock.
    
    
         EXT.  ARCHER HOME -- DAY
    
         Dressed in a gown, Eve joins Castor at the waiting limo.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Where's Jamie?
    
                                  EVE
                        That's what I'd like to
                        know.  She stole fifty
                        dollars from my purse
                        and took off.
    
         CASTOR'S eyes narrow -- trying to read Eve.
    
                                  EVE (cont'd)
                        Don't act so stunned, Jon.
                        As if you don't know how
                        impossible it is to get
                        that girl into a dress.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        I'll deal with her later.
    
                                  EVE
                        Good.  Because I'm fed up.
    
         She leads him into the limo without hesitation.
    
    
         EXT.  LIMO -- MOVING -- DAY
    
         Castor and Eve's limo picks its way through traffic.
    
         ALONGSIDE
    
         rumbles a refrigerator TRUCK from "Bay Gourmet," Inc.
    
         FOLLOW both vehicles as they turn into the driveway of ...
    
    
         EXT.  NEW ST. MARKS HOTEL -- DAY
    
         A high-rise tower with a "flying saucer"-shaped restaurant
         set atop -- the revolving garden restaurant.
    
         CASTOR'S LIMO turns into the circle.
    
         THE BAY GOURMET TRUCK continues into the underground garage.
    
    
         INT.  LOADING DOCK -- DAY
    
         NSA AGENTS poke around the truck as Workers unload icy-fresh
         seafood crates -- onto long metal "roller belts."
    
    
         EXT.  HOTEL -- DAY
    
         CASTOR and EVE exit the limo -- and greet arriving GUESTS.
    
    
         INT.  REFRIGERATOR ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
    
         The fish, shrimp and caviar are stowed.  The door shuts.
    
         A MOMENT LATER -- in the largest crate -- a big black sea-
         bass starts to quiver.  This sea-food really is fresh.  Then
         a hand pushes the fish aside.
    
         ARCHER emerges from beneath the ice and dozens of whole fish
         carcasses.  Freezing, he sniffs himself and heads for the door.
    
    
         INT.  LOBBY -- DAY
    
         CASTOR, EVE and other guests head into the OUTDOOR ELEVATOR
         -- flanked by NSA security agents.  EVE checks her watch.
    
    
         INT.  HOTEL KITCHEN -- DAY
    
         Kitchen workers load pre-prepared food onto the FREIGHT
         ELEVATOR and hit UP.
    
    
         INT.  SHAFT -- DAY
    
         ARCHER squats on the roof of the small freight cabin as it
         ascends.  He's cramped into the small space.
    
    
         INT.  REVOLVING RESTAURANT -- DAY
    
         DING!  The main elevator opens -- CASTOR and EVE are greeted
         by more NSA security agents -- and a round of APPLAUSE from
         the gathered BUREAU CHIEFS and their FAMILIES.
    
         Behind them, a spectacular SUNSET.
    
    
         INT.  SERVICE CORRIDOR
    
         DING!  The FREIGHT ELEVATOR opens up -- hotel staff unload
         it into the rooftop kitchen.
    
         An NSA Security Agent climbs into the freight elevator and
         pushes up the CEILING HATCH.
    
         INSIDE THE SHAFT
    
         The Agent scans around.  Empty.
    
         THE AGENT
    
         hits down.  The elevator descends.
    
    
         INT.  SHAFT
    
         Below, ARCHER presses himself against the shaft wall as the
         elevator drops behind him.  He crawls into an ACCESS HATCH.
    
    
         INT.  MAINTENANCE SHAFT -- DAY
    
         Cramped, noisy and crowded with AUTOMATED WINDOW-WASHING
         DRONES.  Crawling, Archer makes his way to an APERTURE in
         the outside wall.
    
         A DRONE creeps past Archer as it's fed out onto the EXTERIOR
         TRACK.  Archer takes a deep breath -- then grabs hold of it.
    
    
         EXT.  HOTEL -- DAY
    
         Straining, the DRONE continues out of the shaft and UP the
         side of the building.
    
         ARCHER hangs on to the DRONE as it ascends -- finally
         pulling him OFF the narrow ledge and upward -- toward the
         restaurant level.
    
    
         INT.  RESTAURANT -- DAY
    
         Chatting with the bureau chiefs and their wives, EVE turns
         from Wanda to CASTOR.
    
                                  EVE
                        I'm going to the powder
                        room.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Sure, baby -- go anywhere
                        you want.
                            (gestures to Lars)
                        But I have to give you
                        an escort.  Security
                        reasons.
    
         Eve, burying her concern, is forced to follow.
    
    
         EXT.  HOTEL -- DAY
    
         ARCHER hangs from the DRONE.  Reflexively, he looks down.
    
         INSTANT VERTIGO -- a huge drop.
    
         ARCHER regains control.  He forces himself to look UP --
         at a WARNING LABEL on the drone:  "Not For Human Transport."
    
    
         INT.  POWDER ROOM -- DAY
    
         LARS inspects the plush ladies room.  Satisfied, he pushes
         past Eve with barely-disguised contempt.
    
         EVE shuts the door and hurries to the window.  She sees:
    
         INTERCUT:  ARCHER
    
         He clings to the straining, short-circuiting DRONE,
         ascending toward her.
    
         THE DRONE'S cover starts to CRACK under Archer's weight.  He
         can just see EVE in the window -- as he rises.
    
         EVE pulls the surgical laser BONE-SAW from her purse and
         sparks it up.
    
         ARCHER'S coming fast.  The timing must be perfect.
    
         EVE scores the perimeter of the plexiglass window.
    
         IN THE CORRIDOR
    
         Impatient, LARS pushes open the door.
    
                                  LARS
                        What's taking so long?
    
         IN THE RESTROOM
    
         Lars bursts in, scanning the room.  When he heads toward the
         window, Eve blocks his view by banging on the tampon machine
         -- as if it just ate all her change.
    
                                  EVE
                        Got a quarter?
    
         Uncomfortable, LARS fishes into his pocket for two-bits,
         then beats a hasty retreat.  An instant later --
    
         EVE lasers the last section of the window.
    
         ARCHER grinds past, the DRONE breaking away from its track.
    
         EVE stands back as ARCHER kicks in the window -- it CRACKS
         along its scoring -- but doesn't give.
    
         The DRONE breaks off the track and free-falls ... just as ...
    
         ARCHER kicks again -- the window pops in.  ARCHER dangles,
         half-in, half-out.  EVE rushes over -- pulling him in.
    
    
         INT.  CORRIDOR -- NIGHT
    
         EVE exits the rest room.  Lars studies her flushed, agitated
         face -- as they return to the restaurant.
    
    
         INT.  RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
    
         EVE watches as LARS whispers into CASTOR'S ear.  She heads
         for the band-riser and grabs the microphone.
    
                                  EVE
                        Ladies and gentlemen, friends,
                        I know this is primarily a
                        business gathering ... but I'd
                        like to take this opportunity
                        to tell my husband how proud
                        I am of him ... and how much
                        I love him.
    
         EVE nods to the bandleader;  the band strikes up a 90's
         golden oldie.  She hustles Castor onto the dance floor.
    
         THE ROMANTIC SCENE draws the milling guests and agents in
         from the corridor -- allowing ARCHER to make it from the
         restroom into the adjoining STAIRWAY.
    
         ON THE DANCE FLOOR
    
         EVE and CASTOR slow dance to Madonna's "Thief of Hearts."
    
                                  EVE
                        Remember this from our
                        junior prom?  Boy, were
                        you ever mad for Madonna.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Back then -- who wasn't?
    
                                  EVE
                        Wait a second -- you hated
                        Madonna.  Didn't you?
    
         He kisses her neck playfully.  Eve swallows her repulsion.
    
    
         INT.  OFFICE SUITES -- NIGHT
    
         ARCHER silently picks his way through the deserted office.
         he goes into the adjoining --
    
         MAINTENANCE ROOM
    
         ARCHER traces the twisted phalanx of climate-control ducts
         until he sees a RED GLOW.   He pushes the ducts aside to
         reveal the BOMB.  As he steps toward it -- a HULKING SHADOW
         wraps around the wall -- coming toward him.
    
    
         INT.  REVOLVING RESTAURANT -- DANCE FLOOR -- NIGHT
    
         More couples dance alongside Eve and Castor.
    
                                  CASTOR
                            (notices something)
                        Well well.  Here's a surprise.
    
         EVE turns -- and goes pale.  To her horror --
    
         JAMIE stands there.  Looking every inch a young lady, she
         floats toward them in her formal gown.
    
         CASTOR looks into Eve's face -- and he UNDERSTANDS.  She is
         too stunned to react as Castor gives Jamie a big hug.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        There's my little darling.
                            (while looking at Eve)
                        The night wouldn't be
                        complete without you.
    
                                  JAMIE
                        Yeah, mom cut me some slack
                        -- but I decided ... I'd
                        like to be here for you.
                            (produces cash)
                        Here, mom.  You can have
                        it back.  Thanks, though.
    
         EVE is too stunned to react, so Castor pockets the money.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Jamie, have you met
                        Ensign Mancini?
    
         CASTOR passes Jamie off to a young naval CADET, then turns
         to EVE.  She glances furtively around -- searching for a
         solution -- as Castor closes in and speaks quietly.
    
                                  CASTOR (cont'd)
                        Keep your mouth shut and
                        follow me -- or she dies.
                        Right now.
    
    
         INT.  STAIRS -- NIGHT
    
         Alone, CASTOR muscles EVE up the stairs.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Too bad.  Part of me was
                        hoping you didn't know.
                        Guess which part.
    
    
         INT.  OFFICE SUITE -- NIGHT
    
         CASTOR pushes EVE to the floor.  To her shock, ARCHER is
         beside her, the twins' gun to his head.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Did you really think it would
                        be that easy, you dumb fucks?
                        I knew you'd make your move --
                        all I had to do was wait.
                            (a beat)
                        Here's tomorrow's front page:
                        In a suicide attack, Castor
                        Troy -- that's you, Jon --
                        eluded hotel security and
                        detonated a biological bomb,
                        killing dozens of NSA agents
                        and their families -- including
                        my beloved wife and daughter.
                            (a beat)
                        -- And the last three people
                        who could expose me are dead.
    
         Playing for time, Archer scans the room and sees the TABLE
         LAMP nearby -- the only light burning in the suite -- and
         his only chance.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        This is between you and me.
                        Leave my family out of this.
    
         ARCHER looks at EVE.  She glances down to her purse, spilled
         out below her ... her hand hiding the laser BONE-SAW.
         Archer and Eve share the thinnest, most desperate of smiles.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        It was between you and me --
                        but you couldn't let it go.
                            (cocks pistol)
                        Even your son -- that wasn't
                        supposed to happen.  Not
                        that I was sorry to see the
                        little bastard go ...
    
         ARCHER'S heard enough.  He uncoils -- slapping CASTOR'S hand
         away just as --
    
         EVE lashes out with the now-blazing BONE-SAW -- tearing
         through LARS'S femur.
    
         LARS pitches over, screaming, grabbing his stump.
    
         ARCHER scoops up LARS'S PISTOL as he topples the lamp.
         Sudden darkness is illuminated by staccato flashes as the
         room erupts in gunfire.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Go -- get help!
    
         EVE crawls through the fusillade and out of the office.
    
         ARCHER blasts, his shots chasing CASTOR as --
    
         LUNT charges at ARCHER from the darkness.
    
         ARCHER turns, fires, ducks as --
    
         LUNT -- riddled -- sails over ARCHER and smashes through the
         window, plunging into the abyss.
    
         ARCHER scans for CASTOR in the darkened office -- he's gone.
    
    
         INT.  RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
    
         Reacting to the gunfire, the Security Team mobilizes ...
         when EVE runs smack into Wanda and Buzz.
    
                                  WANDA
                        We heard gunshots --
                        where's the Commander?
    
                                  EVE
                        Wanda, I've got to tell you
                        something.  Something crazy ...
    
    
         INT.  CLIMATE CONTROL -- NIGHT
    
         ARCHER rushes in from the office, picks his way past the
         SKYLIGHT over the Atrium and finds the BOMB.
    
         THE LED counts down ... 24-23-22.
    
         ARCHER carefully grabs the GLASS GLOBE and starts to unscrew
         it from its base.  10-9-8 ...
    
         ARCHER pulls the globe free -- but it trails a ceramic
         DETONATOR mount.  The LED hits 00:00.
    
         CIRCUITS break as the electrical charge SOARS through the
         machine.  ARCHER wraps his hand over the detonator as a
         storm of SPARKS volcano up through the base, searching.
    
         The SPARKS silently recede.  The bomb is dead.
    
                                  CASTOR (o.s.)
                        Not bad.
    
         Still cradling the bomb, ARCHER sees a bloody CASTOR
         watching him from the hatch.
    
                                  CASTOR (cont'd)
                        All you've done is postpone
                        the inevitable.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Kill me -- and you kill
                        yourself.
    
         ARCHER squeezes the globe -- just enough to cause a CRACK.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        What -- what are you doing?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Vacuum-sealed globe ...
                        shouldn't take long.
    
         The crack SPIDER-WEBS through the globe.
    
                                  ARCHER (cont'd)
                        Running out of time, Castor.
                        Put down the gun and I'll
                        neutralize it.
    
         ARCHER shows CASTOR the FAIL-SAFE jet built into the globe.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Do it and your daughter lives.
    
         ARCHER just smiles.  Castor has no leverage at all.
    
         THE CRACKS multiply, covering the globe like veins.
    
         CASTOR drops the gun.  ARCHER triggers the JET.
    
         THERE'S AN INJECTION into the globe just as --
    
         BOOM!  The globe implodes, then explodes, filling the room
         with deadly gas.  ARCHER and CASTOR stare at each other.
    
                                  CASTOR (cont'd)
                        Did you neutralize
                        it in time?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        I don't know.  How long
                        before it kills us?
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Five seconds.
    
         They wait ... the seconds pounding down like thunder.
         Three, four ... five.  Then six and seven.
    
         ARCHER and CASTOR smile, inhaling deeply.  This is the way
         it should be.
    
         Then CASTOR goes for his pistol -- ARCHER lunges and --
    
    
         INT.  ATRIUM -- NIGHT
    
         The skylight EXPLODES downward as ARCHER and CASTOR crash
         through it -- still entangled.
    
         THE MEN collapse hard.  THE GUN clatters across the terrace
         toward the planter of trees.
    
         ARCHER AND CASTOR brutally strangle each other -- digging
         their fingers deep into their throats.  They throttle each
         other so hard, their LARYNX VOCAL CHIPS are dislodged.
    
         THEIR VOICES change, echoing with garbled, robotic static.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Give up, Castor.  People
                        are going to find out.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Not if I kill you first ...
    
         They scramble for the gun -- but A HAND reaches out from the
         Juniper trees and picks it up.  Archer and Castor stop dead
         in their tracks because -- JAMIE APPEARS, holding the pistol.
    
                                  CASTOR (cont'd)
                        Give it here, Jamie.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        No, Jamie.  Don't do it!
    
         Everybody gawks -- because ARCHER and CASTOR are now ...
    
         SPEAKING IN THEIR OWN TRUE VOICES
    
         And nobody is more confused than JAMIE:  the man who looks
         like her father sounds like Castor;  the man who looks like
         Castor sounds like her father.
    
                                  ARCHER (cont'd)
                        Listen to my voice, Jamie.
                        I'm your father.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        It's a trick, Jamie.
                        I'm your father.
    
         Jamie swings the pistol back and forth -- baffled.
    
                                  CASTOR (cont'd)
                        Shoot him, Jamie.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Jamie ...
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Shoot him!
    
         Jamie FIRES.  Archer collapses -- a slug in his shoulder.
         Castor snatches the pistol from Jamie's hand.
    
                                  CASTOR (cont'd)
                        You idiot.  No kid of mine
                        would miss so badly.
    
         He aims the pistol at Archer's head.
    
                                  WANDA (o.s.)
                        Hold it.
    
         WANDA AND BUZZ have burst onto the terrace -- their guns
         leveled.  Eve and the bureau chiefs are right behind.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Just saving the tax-payers
                        the cost of a trial.  So
                        take a hike.
    
                                  BUZZ
                        What's the matter with
                        your voice, Commander?
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Castor Troy almost strangled
                        me to death.  Where the hell
                        were you?
    
                                  WANDA
                        You're both in custody until
                        there's a DNA fingerprinting
                        and we can prove who's who.
                        Now put the gun down.
    
                                  CASTOR
                            (a beat)
                        You can't blame me for trying.
    
         He grabs JAMIE, shoves the gun under her chin -- and
         drags her onto --
    
         A GARDEN PATIO
    
         Using Jamie as a shield, CASTOR backs toward the private
         outdoor ELEVATOR ... ARCHER and the others following.
    
         JAMIE fumbles to pull something from her pocket as CASTOR
         elbows the DOWN button, then aims at the charging ARCHER.
    
                                  CASTOR (cont'd)
                        Say goodbye to daddy.
    
         JAMIE whips out the BUTTERFLY KNIFE -- snaps it open
         expertly -- and sinks it into CASTOR'S thigh.  Jamie dives
         out of the elevator as its doors close.
    
                                  CASTOR (o.s.)
                        You ungrateful delinquent!
    
                                  JAMIE
                        Will someone PLEASE tell
                        me what's going on?
    
         But ARCHER just rushes past her and leaps --
    
         OVER THE RAIL
    
         ARCHER soars -- landing hard on the elevator roof.
    
    
         INT.  ELEVATOR -- DESCENDING -- NIGHT
    
         Wrapping his leg wound, CASTOR fumbles for his pistol as
         ARCHER kicks in the roof escape panel and drops inside.
    
         CASTOR gets off a wild shot as ARCHER grabs for the pistol.
         Boom!  Boom!  Boom!  More errant shots rip through the
         elevator roof.
    
         INSIDE THE SHAFT:  The slugs shred the heavy cables.
    
         INSIDE THE CAR:  The pistol drops as CASTOR tears at ARCHER'S
         face -- ripping the seam across his jawline.  Archer rips
         back at Castor.  But they both react in surprise when --
    
         INSIDE THE SHAFT:  The splitting cable SCREAMS.  The
         ELEVATOR CAR bangs back and forth as the cables give way.
    
         INSIDE THE CAR:  Archer and Castor are thrown around like
         limp rag dolls.
    
    
         INT.  LOBBY -- NIGHT
    
         The elevator CRASHES -- scattering the stunned guests.
    
         CASTOR pulls himself from the wreckage.  No sign of ARCHER.
         He spots his pistol lying in the debris.
    
         He reaches for it but recoils when a BLOODY HAND juts out of
         the twisted steel and tightens around the gun.  ARCHER --
         battered but intact -- rises slowly from the wreckage.
    
         CASTOR backs away and runs out of the lobby.
    
    
         EXT.  HOTEL -- NIGHT
    
         CASTOR limps out as a squad car roars up -- siren blaring.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Castor Troy's in there!
                        Move it or I'll have your
                        badges!
    
         The COPS rush to the entrance.  CASTOR jumps in their car.
         As soon as the cops blow into the hotel -- ARCHER darts out
         from behind the door.
    
         He reaches the curb just in time to see Castor's squad car
         screech out of the driveway.  ARCHER scans the street -- the
         only vehicle in sight is a Delivery Van.
    
    
         EXT.  STREETS -- NIGHT
    
         CASTOR tears down Marina Blvd.  Up ahead -- a BIG SAILBOAT
         being loaded onto a trailer blocks the road.
    
         He cuts the wheel hard.  The squad car jumps the curb --
         bounces down a grassy knoll -- until SMASH!
    
         The car plows into a sign that reads:  "EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE.
         KEEP OUT.  THROUGH TRAFFIC USE TRANS-BAY TUBE."
    
         Castor finds himself at the ...
    
         ENTRANCE TO THE (CLOSED) GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE
    
         CASTOR throws the transmission into reverse as HEADLIGHTS
         burst into view.  And behind the wheel -- JON ARCHER.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        Shit.
    
         CASTOR jacks into drive.  The car shoots onto the bridge.
    
    
         EXT.  GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE -- NIGHT
    
         CASTOR weaves in and out of the cracked asphalt -- banging
         past steel cables and around rusted girders.
    
         ARCHER bulls his way through -- closing in.
    
         CASTOR suddenly drops back.  WHAM!  Sparks fly -- shredding
         metal as Castor rams the van.
    
         WHAM!  Archer returns the favor.
    
         THE VEHICLES SURGE FORWARD -- bashing each other to bits.
         Mufflers, fenders, bumpers and hubcaps tear off and scatter
         like shrapnel behind them.
    
         PICKING UP SPEED, the drivers are so utterly focused, so
         full of hatred -- they don't see what's looming up ahead ...
    
         A BIG CRANE sits on the right side of the bridge.
    
         ARCHER'S heading right for it.  He yanks the wheel and jumps
         the pedestrian walk -- clearing it -- almost ...
    
         A SWINGING CRANE HOOK catches the roof of the van.  It spins
         out and rams the opposite guardrail.
    
         THE RAILING buckles but holds.  Archer tries to restart the
         van when WHAM!  Castor backs right into him.  The railing
         snaps off and plunges into the abyss.
    
         ARCHER fires up the engine -- but gets no traction.  His
         rear wheels spin in the air -- suspended hundreds of feet
         above the bay.
    
         CASTOR wheels around and speeds forward for the kill.
    
         ARCHER kicks out the shattered windshield.
    
         CRUNCH!  The squad car slams into --
    
         THE VAN, sending it tumbling over the edge just as --
    
         ARCHER LEAPS out -- landing hard on the squad car hood.
    
         CASTOR swings the car wildly -- finally throwing Archer.
         Castor looks around -- can't see his enemy -- and decides to
         floor it.  He drives a short ways then ... SLAMS HIS BRAKES.
    
         Castor gets out of the car and walks a few feet.  He peers
         into the black night -- horrified because ...
    
         THERE IS NO MORE BRIDGE!
    
         Castor sizes up the thirty-foot gap -- then turns and ...
    
                                  ARCHER (o.s.)
                        End of the road, Castor.
    
         CASTOR turns to find himself facing ARCHER.  Bruised,
         bloody, nearly unconscious, the lawman levels his pistol
         menacingly.  Castor raises his arms in surrender.
    
                                  CASTOR
                        You won't shoot me, Jon
                        -- I'm unarmed.
    
         Archer hesitates -- his whole being in conflict.  Finally:
    
                                  ARCHER
                        You're right.  I won't
                        shoot you.
    
         He lowers the pistol ... then gives in to the FEELING.
    
                                  ARCHER (cont'd)
                        Not in the face anyway.
    
         ARCHER fires -- BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  CASTOR jerks and reels
         back.  He drops to his knees and looks at Archer in total
         disbelief.  Then he sinks to the pavement and lies still.
    
         Exhausted, ARCHER lets the pistol drop.
    
         BEHIND HIM -- SQUAD CARS close in.  Relieved, he turns back
         to Castor but -- CASTOR'S BODY IS GONE!
    
         ARCHER desperately follows a trail of blood and finds CASTOR
         dragging himself over the edge of the bridge gap.
    
         ARCHER leaps and snags CASTOR'S hand just as he falls.
    
         ARCHER struggles to hang on as CASTOR looks up and smiles --
         his weight pulling ARCHER into the chasm.
    
         He strains and somehow pulls CASTOR back onto the
         bridge.  ARCHER collapses, gasping, on top of CASTOR.
    
         WANDA and BUZZ rush up.
    
                                  BUZZ
                        You okay, Commander?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        What did you call me?
    
                                  WANDA
                        He called you "commander,"
                        Commander.
    
         ARCHER attempts a smile -- then sags to the ground.
    
         LATER -- ON THE BRIDGE
    
         Sealed-off crime scene;  an NSA ambulance loads CASTOR;
         ARCHER'S on a gurney right behind.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        How is he?
    
                                  EVE
                        No life signs at all.
                        He's a turnip.
    
                                  ARCHER
                        That's what they always say.
    
         Eve tries to climb into the ambulance.  Wanda stops her.
    
                                  WANDA
                        We'll take him from here.
    
                                  EVE
                        But he's my husband.
    
                                  WANDA
                        But he works for us.
    
         ARCHER'S loaded -- Eve hands onto his fingers until the very
         last moment.  Eye-contact:  tired, relieved.  The door
         SHUTS and the ambulance takes off -- leaving Eve behind.
    
    
         INT.  ARCHER'S HOUSE -- DAY
    
         Maybe days, maybe weeks later -- no way to tell.  EVE is
         at the dining room table, catching up on medical reports.
    
         Sensing something, she looks up and sees a SILHOUETTE at
         the front screen-door -- a MAN'S silhouette.
    
                                  ARCHER'S VOICE
                        Hello, Eve.
    
         Pulse pounding, EVE frantically pushes open the door to
         glimpse the face of the man with ARCHER'S voice.
    
         IT'S JON ARCHER
    
         EVE stares -- then touches his face carefully, tenderly --
         searching for a clue, a FEELING that will reveal the truth.
    
                                  EVE
                        I started wondering -- if
                        you couldn't switch back --
                        would it make a difference?
    
                                  ARCHER
                        Would it?
    
                                  EVE
                        Damn right.
    
         EVE pulls him tight -- holding on for dear life.
    
                                  JAMIE (o.s.)
                        Dad?
    
         JAMIE is there.  ARCHER smiles -- gently, almost sadly --
         with a softness and genuineness that Castor Troy could never
         feel, could never fake.
    
         She rushes to him.  The whole family hangs on, hugging and
         kissing -- for the first time ever, really TOGETHER.
    
         DISSOLVE TO:
    
         INT.  ARCHER HOME -- NIGHT
    
         Midnight.  JAMIE sleeps peacefully.
    
         Likewise EVE ... until something rouses her.  Waking, she
         sees ARCHER isn't there ... then hears something.  Looking
         out the window, she sees --
    
         IN THE DRIVEWAY
    
         ARCHER takes aim at the basket.  He buries a free throw,
         making it look easy.  His shooting style is chillingly
         familiar ... or was it just a lucky shot?
    
    
         FADE OUT ...
