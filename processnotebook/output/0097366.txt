_FLETCH LIVES_

1 EXT. POSH GREEK SEAFOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

It's past midnight. A neon sign: "Kakakis Cafe". A "Closed" sign on the door,
but a light still burns inside.

2 INT. RESTAURANT - TIGHT ON A TANK OF FIGHTING LOBSTERS

PAN off to a vast sea of empty tables and chairs. Five MEN sit at the only
occupied table. Three are the owners, the three Kakakis brothers; the others
are a plain-clothes policeman, O'RIELLY, and an accountant, who sits with open
books and a calculator.

ACCOUNTANT

We took in one hundred thirteen thousand

from basketball.

PHIL

List it as codfish.

ACCOUNTANT

A hundred twenty thousand from the Gonzalez fight.

That includes sixty from our chain in the valley,

twenty from Long Beach. Hundred twenty total.

TONY

Put that under halibut.

ACCOUNTANT

One eighty thousand from the track.

PHIL

Scrod.

ACCOUNTANT

We already got over two million in scrod this month!

TONY

What's the guy from the IRS gonna say?

PHIL

He's not gonna say anything. He's the biggest

expense under scrod.

As the conversation continues, the CAMERA DOLLYS across the tile floor to
reveal a very large SCRUBWOMAN wearing a dirty white dress, sensible Wedgies
and her hair in a bun. She's humming "The Song of the Volga Boatmen". The
scrubwoman reaches into the bucket with a sponge.

3 INSERT BUCKET

Dirty water, but in the rinse rack, under a dirty sponge, a steno pan on which
abundant notes are scrawled, and an attached pencil.

4 THE SCRUBWOMAN'S POV

O'REILLY

How're you listing my stake?

PHIL

Breakage.

O'REILLY

Seventy five thousand dollars worth of breakage?

PHIL

(breaking a plate in front of the cop)

We're Greeks. We dance. We throw plates. We're clumsy.

5 INSERT STENO PAD

The scrubwoman writes:

150 G = Police Bribe

PAN UP to REVEAL SCRUBWOMAN'S FACE.

It's FLETCH. A convincing disguise, right down to a beauty mark on the right
cheek.

6 WIDER

He begins to crawl out on his hands and knees, still humming.

7 INT. THE HALLWAY TO THE PHONE AND RESTROOMS

UNCLE KAKAKIS, who with his limited vision and unlimited libido is immediately
attracted to the zaftig scrublady. His appointment as security guard was
clearly an act of charity. He catches up with the scrublady and puts his hand
on Fletch's left buttock.

UNCLE KAKAKIS

What's your name, little lady?

Fletch flashes a half-hearted smile.

UNCLE KAKAKIS

(continuing)

You're cute...

He grabs Fletch's leg.

UNCLE KAKAKIS

I like a woman with big thighs.

Suddenly Uncle Kakakis freezes and his eyes go wide.

UNCLE KAKAKIS

(continuing)

What's that?

FLETCH

A polish sausage. I stole it from the kitchen.

Please don't tell.

UNCLE KAKAKIS

(looking him in the eye)

Well..we need to talk about this.

FLETCH

Could I just freshen up? Splash some

water on my face?

UNCLE KAKAKIS

Whatever makes you feel sexy.

8 INT. LADIES' ROOM

Fletch looks around, sees an open window above the sink. He turns on the water
to cover the noise of climbing out. He hikes up his skirt, revealing his boxer
shorts and hairy legs, and making it easier to climb out the window.

9 EXT. ALLEY - CLOSE ON FLETCH

as he looks out the window.

10 HIS POV

He's about ten feet in the air, but fortunately there's a black sedan parked
under the window.

11 THE HOOD

as he drops onto it and goes into a crouch to soften his drop. He looks into
the sedan.

12 THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

The Kakakis brothers, preparing to drive off, have seen him and recognize his
as both the maid and a man. His steno pad in his hand.

13 THE GEAR SHIFT

slammed into reverse as the car hurtles backwards.

14 FLETCH

is rolled off the car and lies dazed at the end of the alley.

15 INT. SEDAN

PHIL

He's either an honest cop or a nosy reporter.

TONY

If it's a cop, kill him. If it's a reporter, cripple him.

DRIVER

How can I tell?

TONY

(shrugs)

Just kill him.

16 EXT. ALLEY

They slam the stickshift into gear and speed toward the stunned Fletch.

He rolls out of the way at the last minute, and the sedan slams into the wall
at the end of the alley. The men are trapped inside the crumpled car.

17 FLETCH

Picks himself up and, hobbling on one Wedgie, disappears around the corner.

18 CLOSE ON A TYPEWRITTEN HEADLINE:

"SOMETHING'S FISHY - A JANE DOE EXPOSE"

WIDE TO REVEAL

18-40 INT. FLETCH'S NEWSPAPER - FRANK'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Fletch stands in front of Frank's desk. His wig is off but he still wears the
dress and has rouge on his cheeks.

FRANK

(laying down the copy)

It's great, as usual, Fletch. We'll have

it in the next edition.

FLETCH

Good. See you in two weeks.

FRANK

Uh...Fletch...

FLETCH

"Uh...Fletch?" Frank, I see a double

cross in your eyes. You promised me

a vacation and I'm taking it.

FRANK

(out the door)

After the sewer story.

41 INT. CITY ROOM

The few remaining STAFF people watch as Fletch, still wearing only one shoe,
hounds Frank across the room.

FLETCH

What are you talking about? I spent eight nights

scrubbing floors, then I rushed back to type the

story in time, I got dishwater hands, sore knees,

some guy tried to feel me up, three guys tried to

kill me, and my girdle is killing me. Frank, you

promised me a vacation.

FRANK

And you'll have a vacation - right after

you research and write the sewer system expose.

FLETCH

Frank, you owe me a vacation.

FRANK

And you'll have it in July.

FLETCH

That's two months away.

FRANK

That's why you're a great reporter. You

know the facts.

(pausing at the exit)

By the way, Fletch, the new computer disallowed

your undocumented expenses. The money you owe is

being taken out of this week's check.

FLETCH

Frank, you can't...

FRANK

There's nothing I can do about it.

It's all done automatically...

Frank leaves.

Fletch looks pitiful indeed as he stands next to the water cooler in his
washerwoman attire. The only worker near him is an ANCIENT COPY BOY, emptying
a file. Fletch puts one hand on his own aching back.

FLETCH

(to the copy boy)

On top of everything else, I'm getting my period.

42 EXT. FLETCH'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAWN

He drops his weary carcass into the building.

43 INT. HALLWAY IN FRONT OF FLETCH'S APARTMENT

Stuffed in his doorway is a bill from the landlady stamped "OVERDUE" and a
"Fumigation Alert". He wads in disgust.

44 INT. APARTMENT

Fletch enters and looks.

45 FLETCH'S POV

Gillet is sitting on Fletch's couch, reading a magazine and drinking a glass
of juice, his briefcase at his feet.

FLETCH

No wonder I got a fumigation alert.

He looks toward his kitchen window, and through it to the fire escape. The
window is open.

FLETCH

(continuing)

How did you get in here?

GILLET

The window was open. I knocked. I could

swear I heard you say, "Come in."

FLETCH

You sure know how to cover your ass...

although those pants are a big mistake.

GILLET

I'm not leaving until you pay me four

thousand three hundred and eighty-one

dollars in back alimony.

FLETCH

What? I was married to _you?_

Gillet shakes his head in disgust.

FLETCH

You're right. I've been foolishly squandering

my salary on food and heat. Besides, I hear she's

sleeping with a wimpy, balding lawyer

who's rolling in dough.

GILLET

(Pointing to a court order in his open briefcase)

You have one week to comply with Judge Proctor's

orders - payment in full. Otherwise, you go to jail.

FLETCH

(examining the briefcase)

Nice briefcase. Isn't this what they

give you when you stay five nights and

only use one towel at a Motel Six? Must

look great in the back seat of your Yugo.

(he picks something up)

Look. Here's a note from the Oakwood Potency

Clinic. "Sorry to inform you that our machine

cannot process sperm counts as low as yours."

GILLET

(finishing his juice)

Let me have my briefcase, please.

FLETCH

(looking further)

"Boys in Bondage". Look...they've added

a scratch 'n' sniff page!

(He holds up a floppy disk in

it's protective envelope)

What is this?

GILLET

Fletch, put that down!

FLETCH

(reading a note book)

How efficient. I'll bet you've got all

your records in one notebook...oops.

He drops the notebook and steps on it. Then he drops everything in the
briefcase.

FLETCH

Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

As Gillet ad libs complaints, Fletch puts the contents of the briefcase in the
sink and scrubs them with wire brush.

FLETCH

(continuing)

let me wash this off for you. Oh, no,

I dropped it; I'll get it clean. There

you go - clean as a whistle.

He snaps Gillet's briefcase closed and opens the door for him, handing him the
disk.

FLETCH

(continuing)

47 INT. - FLETCH

turns on his answering machine. It plays on and on as he removes the rouge and
his scrubwoman disguise.

MACHINE

Hi, Fletch. This is Madeleine. I know we were

supposed to get together tomorrow night. But my

horoscope says Scorpios should avoid physical contact

for the rest of the month. Maybe my astrologist was

just telling me this because he wants to keep me to

himself. But he wouldn't do a thing like that, would he?

I mean, they're like doctors...

Fletch spins ahead.

NEW VOICE

It's Lou at Paine Webber. I didn't think

your stock could go lower, but...

Fletch spins ahead and stops at an unfamiliar voice. During the following he
lies on his sofa, exhausted.

MESSAGE

This is Amanda Ray Ross. It's Thursday,

five p.m. I can be reached at my office

at (504)456-7823.

(Fletch is falling asleep)

I'm an attorney in Thibodaux, Louisiana.

I'm also the executor of the will for your

Aunt Belle Fletcher. I would like to offer

my condolences and inform you that you are

the major beneficiary of her estate.

All this has fallen on sleeping ears. Fletch is lying on his bed, snoring.
