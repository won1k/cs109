               FADE IN:

               EXT. DESERT OF THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST - DAY

               A mountain peak dominates the landscape.

               TITLES BEGIN

               Riders on horseback cross the desert. From this distance 
               they appear to be a company of Army Cavalry Soldiers.

               CLOSER ANGLES ON THE RIDERS

               Reveal only details of saddles, hooves and uniforms. The 
               riders are silhouetted against the rising sun as they ride 
               into an ancient CLIFF PUEBLO.

               The OFFICER IN COMMAND raises his hand halting his troops.

                                     OFFICER
                         Dis-mount!

               RIDERS climb down from their mounts... and only now do we 
               realize that this is a TROOP OF BOY SCOUTS, all of them about 
               thirteen years of age. The "Commanding Officer" is only their 
               SCOUTMASTER, Mr. Havelock.

               One of the Scouts, a pudgy kid named HERMAN, steps away from 
               his horse, bends over and pukes. The other Scouts rag on 
               him.

                                     FIRST SCOUT
                         Herman's horsesick!

               A BLOND SCOUT, however, befriends Herman. He has a thatch of 
               straw-colored hair and the no-nonsense expression common to 
               kids whose curiosity and appetite for knowledge exceed what 
               they teach in school. Additionally, he has adorned his uniform 
               with an authentic HOPI INDIAN WOVEN BELT.

                                     SCOUTMASTER
                         Chaps, don't anybody wander off. 
                         Some of the passageways in here can 
                         run for miles.

               Two Boy Scouts climb up the rocky base of the cliff.

               INT. THE PASSAGEWAY - DAY

               The two boys head down the passageway. It's dark, and the 
               temperature drops several degrees. Spiders have built huge 
               webs that get caught in the boys' hair.

               Herman appears very uncertain as to the wisdom of this 
               enterprise, but he's drawn on by his companion's adventurous 
               curiosity.

                                     HERMAN
                         I don't think this is such a good 
                         idea.

               LAUGHTER is HEARD; the Blond Scout pulls Herman forward toward 
               its source.

               The VOICES GROW LOUDER now as the boys get closer to their 
               source. The light of kerosene lanterns dances on the tunnel 
               walls ahead. The boys approach cautiously, careful to stay 
               hidden.

                                     HERMAN
                         What is it?

               This is what they see:

               FOUR MEN digging with shovels and pick-axes. They have broken 
               into one of the pueblo's SECRET CHAMBERS... called "Kivas."

               The men are ROUGH RIDER (his name describes his dress), ROSCOE 
               (a Bowery Boy bully of 14) and HALFBREED (with straight black 
               hair that cascades over his shoulders).

               And the fourth man wears a LEATHER WAIST JACKET and BROWN 
               FELT FEDORA HAT. He has his back turned to us, but we would 
               be willing to bet anything that this is INDIANA JONES.

               However, when the man turns, and his face is illuminated by 
               the lantern's glow, we are shocked to discover that it is 
               someone else.

               We'll call him FEDORA.

               TITLES END

               The TWO BOYS are mesmerized by what they see.

               Now we realize that the Blond Scout is actually young INDIANA 
               JONES.

                                     FEDORA
                         Alfred, did you get anything yet?

                                     MAN
                         Nothing. Dig in.

               Two of the men stand and look at Roscoe who steps forward 
               holding a box in his hands.

                                     ROSCOE
                         Hey, I've got something!

               Whoops from the other men.

                                     ROSCOE
                         I got something, Garth!

               Roscoe rushes forward and gives Fedora the box. Fedora steps 
               toward a lantern resting on a rock.

                                     ROSCOE
                         I got something... I got something 
                         right here.

               More whoops from the other men.

               Fedora puts the box on the rock next to the lantern. Halfbreed 
               pushes Roscoe as he jumps with excitement. Rough Rider steps 
               forward to look at the box as Fedora opens it.

                                     ROSCOE
                              (more whoops; then)
                         Oh, look at that!
                              (more whoops)
                         We're rich! We're rich!

                                     HALFBREED
                         Shut up. Shut up.

               Fedora takes a BEJEWELED CROSS from the box and holds it 
               aloft. Fedora's comrades practically salivate at the sight 
               of it.

                                     ROSCOE (O.S.)
                         Well, we're rich, ain't we?!

               Indy takes off his hat and looks down at the off screen 
               action.

                                     HERMAN
                         Indy? Indy? What are they doing? 
                         Indiana? Indiana?

                                     INDY
                         Shhh!

               Fedora blows dust from the Cross, turning it in his hand, 
               silently appraising its beauty... and its value. He seems 
               aloof from the others; somehow superior to them.

                                     HALFBREED
                         Hey, we got to find more stuff to 
                         bring back.

               Indy stays hidden, but is astounded by what he sees.

                                     INDY
                              (hushed; urgent)
                         It's the Cross of Coronado! Cortes 
                         gave it to him in 1521.

               Fedora continues to admire the Cross, then places it on the 
               rock next to its box and the lantern.

               Indy turns back to observe the men.

                                     INDY
                         That Cross is an important artifact. 
                         It belongs in a museum.

               A look of resolve comes into Indy's expression, and he turns 
               back toward Herman

                                     INDY
                         Run back and find the others. Tell 
                         Mister Havelock that there are men 
                         looting in the caves.

               Herman doesn't seem to be listening. Instead, he watches in 
               wide-eyed horror as a SNAKE SLITHERS ACROSS HIS LAP.

                                     INDY
                         Have him bring the sheriff.

               Indy matter-of-factly picks up the snake and tosses it aside. 
               Herman gasps.

                                     INDY
                         It's only a snake.

               Indy grabs Herman's scout scarf and pulls him closer.

                                     INDY
                         Did you hear what I said?

                                     HERMAN
                         Right. Run back. Mister Havelock. 
                         The Sheriff. What, what are you gonna 
                         do?

                                     INDY
                         I don't know... I'll think of 
                         something.

               Indy releases the scarf, gives Herman a pat and Herman dashes 
               off. Indy sees the Cross on the rock next to the lantern. As 
               the Robbers continue to search for additional valuables, 
               Indy is able to work his way unseen to within arm's reach of 
               the Cross...

               Fedora looks over at the men digging in a hole b.g.

                                     FEDORA
                         Dig with your hands.

               Indy picks up the Cross.

                                     FEDORA (O.S.)
                         Not with your mouth.

               As Fedora stands watching the other men digging, Indy puts 
               the Cross in his pants and begins to pull himself up a rope 
               hanging nearby. As he climbs, Indy's feet break a wooden 
               beam, attracting the men's attention.

                                     ROSCOE
                         He's got our thing!

                                     HALFBREED
                         Get 'im!

               The three Robbers are so eager to get their hands on Indy, 
               they almost knock each other over in the attempt.

               Only Fedora is unperturbed. He casts a disgusted glance in 
               the direction of his fleeing companions -- then sets off 
               after Indy.

               EXT. THE CLIFFS - DAY

               Indy EMERGES from the darkness of the Pueblo into the 
               brightness of day.

               He pauses -- squints -- shields his eyes -- looks in all 
               directions.

                                     INDY
                         Mister Havelock! Anybody! Everybody's 
                         lost but me!

               He hears RUNNING FOOTSTEPS BEHIND HIM and dashes off. Rough 
               Rider, Halfbreed, and Roscoe are quick to appear and run 
               after him.

                                     FEDORA
                         There he is!

                                     MEN
                              (ad-libs)
                         Let's go! Let's get him! Let's go!

               Indy jumps from one rock to another; the SCOUT TROOP HORSES 
               are below. Indy puts two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES 
               for his horse, who trots over. Indy puts the Cross in his 
               belt.

               Indy PREPARES TO JUMP into the saddle. Hesitates. Then... he 
               JUMPS. But the horse moves exactly at the wrong moment and 
               Indy lands flat on his feet in a standing position. The impact 
               sends a shock wave up his body that rattles his back teeth. 
               Indy stands up and successfully mounts his horse.

               Fedora AND HIS MEN ARRIVE at the roof's edge in time to see 
               Indy climb into the saddle and gallop off.

                                     INDY
                         Hyah! Hyah!

                                     ROSCOE
                         Hey! Come back here!

               Fedora puts two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES... and a 
               VINTAGE TRUCK AND AUTOMOBILE come ROARING OUT from behind 
               the Pueblo (driven by two more gang members). Now we 
               glimpse...

               THE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT

               The passenger in the car. His face is concealed by the hat's 
               wide brim. His arm is out the window, however, and we see an 
               olive-colored hand protruding from the sleeve of an expensive 
               white linen suit. He gestures to the Robbers, now in the 
               truck.

                                     PANAMA HAT
                         Come on. Get him!

               Indy SPURS his mount on to greater speeds but the autos not 
               only keep pace with his horse... they begin to squeeze in on 
               it.

               Speeding Autos. Thundering hooves. Rushing wind. Flying dust. 
               Indy crouched low and leaning forward in the saddle, his 
               heart pounding, his adrenaline pumping.

               Indy VEERS OFF in a new direction -- toward a RAILROAD TRACK.

               EXT. A CIRCUS TRAIN - DAY

               The train is barreling down the track. Indy rides up beside 
               it. He glances over his shoulder and sees the car and truck 
               gaining on him. No other choice... he LEAPS FROM HORSE TO 
               TRAIN.

               He clings to the side of a BOXCAR, as Halfbreed and Rough 
               Rider leap from the truck onto the train.

               Halfbreed tries to grab Indy, but Indy leaps onto another 
               boxcar. Halfbreed runs after him but Indy leaps from the 
               boxcar onto some covered boxes stacked on a flatcar.

               Indy loses his balance but regains it. With Halfbreed and 
               Rough Rider still running after him, Indy enters the trap 
               door of...

               INT. THE REPTILE CAR - DAY

               and finds himself CRAWLING on a CATWALK suspended from the 
               car's ceiling. Several feet below are NUMEROUS VATS containing 
               all manner of reptiles: Alligators, crocodiles, giant lizards, 
               etc.

               Then, Halfbreed ENTERS through the trap door -- followed by 
               Rough Rider. Halfbreed grabs hold of Indy's feet, but Indy 
               kicks at him and he loses his grasp.

               Indy crawls away, toward an opening on the opposite side. 
               Halfbreed grabs at Indy's feet again; Indy rolls away and we 
               SEE large bins of squirming snakes.

               The combined weight of the three people is more than the 
               catwalk was intended for, and the BOLTS BEGIN TO RIP FROM 
               THE CEILING.

               Everyone holds their breath, afraid to make another move. 
               Too late. SEVERAL BOLTS TEAR FREE. Halfbreed and Rough Rider 
               SCREAM... but it's Indy's end of the catwalk that DROPS 
               DOWN... PLUNGING Indy to the floor of the car.

               He lands hard, with a SPLASH into a vat of water... where he 
               finds himself eye-to-eye with an --

               ENORMOUS ANACONDA

               The head of this snake is so damn big, it looks more like a 
               Tyrannosaurus Rex.

                                     INDY
                         Oh...

               Indy jumps back in horror... only to land with a SQUISH into 
               the SNAKE VAT.

                                     INDY
                         Oh... Oh...

               Hundreds of slippery, squirming snakes. Indy sinks into them. 
               They cover him. Engulf him. Almost smother him.

               Indy jumps out of the side of the vat, freeing himself.

               Indy locates a clean-out door at the bottom of the car and 
               uses it to escape.

               Halfbreed, meanwhile, tries to open the closed window of the 
               car. He groans. Rough Rider moves to assist him.

                                     ROUGH RIDER
                         Here, let me.

               EXT. THE TRAIN - DAY

               Indy stops, checks to see the Cross still lodged in his belt. 
               Suddenly he looks worried as he frantically reaches into his 
               shirt, REMOVES A SNAKE FROM IT and tosses it away.

               Roscoe APPEARS atop the reptile car and manages to grab Indy. 
               Indy kicks at him. Roscoe grabs onto the side of the reptile 
               car as Indy moves on to...

               EXT. A FLATCAR - DAY

               Indy climbs over canvas-covered circus equipment. Roscoe 
               follows, grabbing a long stick with a hook on it. He reaches 
               forward and trips Indy, who falls onto the roof of the rhino 
               boxcar.

               INT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY

               As a lamp falls from the ceiling with the impact of Indy's 
               fall, hitting a HUGE BLACK RHINOCEROS.

               EXT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY

               Roscoe grabs Indy by the ankle and yanks him off his feet. 
               The two struggle, rolling from side to side, coming perilously 
               close to rolling right off the edge. Things get even more 
               serious when Roscoe PULLS A KNIFE.

               IN THE BOXCAR BELOW

               ...THE FEROCIOUS BLACK RHINO is becoming extremely agitated 
               by the commotion going on atop his cage. Finally, he raises 
               his head and THRUSTS HIS HORN THROUGH THE ROOF.

               BACK TO THE ROOFTOP

               As the horn SMASHES through the wood only inches from Indy's 
               head. Indy and Roscoe stare at the horn in amazement as they 
               continue to struggle. SMASH! The horn comes up again -- RIGHT 
               BETWEEN INDY'S LEGS.

                                     INDY
                         Holy smokes!

               Indy kicks Roscoe away. Roscoe rolls to the edge of the car 
               but keeps from falling. Indy flips over onto his stomach.

               EXT. THE REPTILE CAR - DAY

               The WOODEN TRAP DOOR EXPLODES as a BULLET is FIRED from 
               within. The door is pushed open and Halfbreed and Rough Rider 
               hurry out of the car.

               EXT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY

               Indy gets to his feet -- looks ahead -- sees a WATER TANK 
               alongside the track directly up ahead. Indy gets an idea...

               In an instant, he calculates his approach -- times the 
               distance -- and LEAPS for the tank's WATER SPOUT.

               He catches it perfectly... but his velocity causes the water 
               spout to ROTATE A FULL 360 DEGREES. With Indy hanging on, 
               feet kicking, the water spout deposits him back on the train, 
               onto the ROOF OF A STOCKCAR, where he looks up to see Fedora 
               walking toward him.

                                     FEDORA
                         Come on, kid. There's no way out of 
                         this.

               As Indy edges away from Fedora, a portion of the STOCKCAR'S 
               ROOF COLLAPSES and Indy FALLS THROUGH into the car below.

               INT. THE STOCKCAR - DAY

               Indy CRASHES down from above. Dust rises.

                                     INDY
                         Ohhh!

               Indy's eyes take a moment to adjust to the dark. A bit of 
               sunlight leaks in through the cracks between the boards.

               Then Indy sees it. At the far end of the boxcar. Rising slowly 
               to its feet... an AFRICAN LION. The Lion ROARS. The boxcar 
               walls shake. Indy gasps. Dust swirls up into the shafts of 
               sunlight.

               And Indy has one more surprise in store: The Cross of Cortes 
               has been dislodged from his belt during the fall...

               Indy glances around, sees a coiled LION TAMER'S WHIP hanging 
               on a nail. He carefully takes it down by the handle. The 
               Lion sees this and GROWLS SOFTLY.

               Indy swallows hard and gives the whip a try. It unravels 
               awkwardly, its TIP flying back and HITTING Indy IN THE FACE... 
               CUTTING his chin.

               The Lion GROWLS LOUDER. Indy quickly gathers up the whip, 
               wets his lips, and tries again. This time -- success! The 
               WHIP CRACKS SHARPLY. The Lion BELLOWS and SWATS the air... 
               and steps back.

               Indy looks amazed and delighted. He CRACKS the whip again. 
               The Lion backs away even more. Indy inches forward -- bends 
               down (never taking his eyes off the Lion) -- picks up the 
               Cross -- and steps back again, sweat pouring down his face.

               But now... how to get out?

               He looks up at the opening through which he fell and sees 
               Fedora LOOKING DOWN AT HIM. Fedora extends his hand.

                                     FEDORA
                         Toss up the whip.

               EXT. THE ROOFTOP OF STOCKCAR

               Fedora, assisted by Halfbreed and Rough Rider, "reels" Indy 
               out of the Stockcar as the Lion ROARS and lunges and Indy 
               screams.

               The men, including Roscoe, pull Indy through the hole in the 
               roof. He stands to face them as Rough Rider points a gun in 
               his direction.

                                     FEDORA
                         You've got heart, kid.
                              (indicates Cross)
                         But that belongs to me.

                                     INDY
                              (takes Cross from his 
                              belt)
                         It belongs to Coronado.

                                     FEDORA
                              (overlapping)
                         Coronado is dead. And so are all his 
                         grandchildren.

                                     INDY
                         This should be in a museum.

                                     ROSCOE
                         Now give me that!

               Roscoe makes a grab for the Cross -- but Indy doesn't let 
               go. A tug-of-war ensues until a SNAKE WIGGLES OUT FROM INDY'S 
               SHIRTSLEEVE and WRAPS AROUND Roscoe's hand.

               Roscoe SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER -- releases his grip on the 
               Cross and tries to shake off the snake. This is all the 
               opportunity Indy needs. He LEAPS ONTO THE NEXT CAR.

                                     FEDORA
                         Don't let him get away!

               Indy swings down to the caboose. He sees a sign above the 
               caboose door reading "DR. FANTASY'S MAGIC CABOOSE."

                                     INDY
                         Magic?

               He glances back at the men and quickly opens the door to the 
               caboose, stepping inside.

               Fedora puts out his arm, gesturing for the others not to 
               follow Indy.

                                     FEDORA
                         Hold it. Make sure he doesn't double 
                         back.

               INT. THE CABOOSE - DAY

               Which contains the circus MAGIC EQUIPMENT. Indy rushes to 
               the rear door of the caboose but can't open it. He hears 
               Fedora coming, and dives into a MAGIC BOX.

                                     FEDORA
                         Okay, kid. Out of the box. Now.

               Fedora smiles confidently and advances toward the box. The 
               box unexpectedly collapses; all four sides flop away... 
               revealing NOTHING. Indy has completely vanished.

               Fedora is mystified, frustrated and angered. Then he feels a 
               breeze at his back. He turns and discovers that the caboose 
               door is open. He rushes out onto the balcony and sees:

               Indy RUNNING along the tracks, turning up a street of modest 
               clapboard houses.

                                     FEDORA
                         Damn.

               EXT. STREET - SMALL TOWN - DAY

               As Indy runs from the railroad tracks and approaches his 
               house we see the name "JONES" painted on the mailbox.

                                     INDY
                         Dad!

               INT. THE HOUSE - DAY

               Indy bursts through the front door holding the Cross in his 
               hand. A Husky BARKS as Indy runs past in search of his father.

                                     INDY
                         Dad!

               INT. THE STUDY - DAY

               Indy charges in. The study is cluttered with books. Pictures, 
               charts and maps clearly reflect the father's passion for 
               Medieval studies.

               PROFESSOR Henry JONES is absorbed at his desk. In fact, he 
               is studying a very ancient parchment volume which lies open 
               on the desk. The page shows a beautifully illuminated picture 
               of what might be a stained-glass window. The sketch 
               incorporates a series of Roman numerals. The Professor is 
               not just studying it, he is copying it into his own notebook.

               We never get to see the Professor's face in this scene. So 
               Indy CHARGES IN.

                                     INDY
                         Dad!

                                     HENRY
                         Out!

                                     INDY
                         It's important!

                                     HENRY
                         Then wait -- count to twenty.

                                     INDY
                         No, Dad. You listen to me --

                                     HENRY
                              (now he shouts)
                         Junior!

               No question who is the boss here. Indy gulps, his look says 
               "What am I going to do with this guy?" And obeys -- starts 
               counting, VERY, VERY FAINTLY.

                                     INDY
                         One, two, three, four...

               Now we see what Henry is concentrating on. We see his hand 
               sketching; then, he holds up one finger.

                                     HENRY
                         In Greek.

               Indy's reaction:

                                     INDY
                              (louder, in Greek)
                         One... two... three... four...

               An ancient car is heard arriving. Perhaps Indy glimpses it 
               going past the window. Anyway, it stops outside the house. 
               Two men sit in the front seat. Herman sits in the rear, 
               BLOWING A TRUMPET.

               Indy's reaction: Trouble!

               Henry is just finishing the sketch.

                                     HENRY
                         May he who illuminated this... 
                         illuminate me...

               INT. THE FRONT ROOM - DAY

               The study door is just closing, Indy closing it behind him... 
               just as Herman comes through the front door, still playing 
               the trumpet.

               Indy reaches for the trumpet, pulling it from Herman's mouth. 
               Herman continues to spit -- right into Indy's face. Indy 
               flinches.

                                     HERMAN
                         I brought the Sheriff.

               Herman means the SHERIFF, who now enters the house.

                                     INDY
                         Just the man I want to see! Now, 
                         there were five or six of them.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (interrupting)
                         All right, son.

                                     INDY
                              (overlapping)
                         ...they came after... me...

                                     SHERIFF
                         You still got it?

                                     INDY
                         Well, yes, sir. It's right here!

               Indy shows the Cross, more or less handing it to the Sheriff 
               to make his point. The Sheriff takes it casually.

                                     SHERIFF
                         I'm glad to see that... because the 
                         rightful owner of this Cross won't 
                         press charges, if you give it back.

               Fedora enters the house, followed by Roscoe, Rough Rider and 
               Halfbreed. He politely removes his hat and holds it in his 
               hand. He nods at Indy in a friendly manner.

                                     SHERIFF
                         He's got witnesses, five or six of 
                         them.

               The Sheriff and Fedora are in Cahoots

               The Sheriff hands the Cross to Fedora. Roscoe reaches in and 
               takes it from Fedora, then runs out the door.

                                     ROSCOE
                         Yahoo!

               As Roscoe runs outside Indy sees -- through the screen door -- 
               the MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT waiting patiently beside the car 
               that is parked out front. Roscoe approaches and gives the 
               Man the Cross -- the Man hands Roscoe some money in exchange.

               The Sheriff tips his hat and leaves.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Good day.

               Fedora remains behind for a moment. He turns and speaks to 
               Indy in an ironic man-to-man way.

                                     FEDORA
                         You lost today, kid, but that doesn't 
                         mean you have to like it.

               Then, Fedora takes off his hat and takes a step towards Indy. 
               He holds the hat by the crown, and puts it on Indy's head, a 
               show of respect and admiration for the boy. The hat blocks 
               Indy's face.

               CLOSE ON THE TOP OF THE FEDORA HAT

               The hat brim fills the screen. As the brim tilts up, WE SEE 
               the face of FULL GROWN INDIANA JONES.

               And... POW!... he's punched in the face while his arms are 
               pinned behind his back.

               FADE IN TITLE: "PORTUGUESE COAST - 1938"

                                     PANAMA HAT
                         Small world, Doctor Jones.

                                     INDY
                         Too small for two of us.

               THE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT (years older now) removes the CROSS 
               OF CORONADO from Indy's belt.

                                     PANAMA HAT
                         This is the second time I've had to 
                         reclaim my property from you --

                                     INDY
                         That belongs in a museum --

                                     PANAMA HAT
                         So do you.
                              (he moves his eyeline)
                         Throw him over the side.

               THE DECK OF A PORTUGUESE CARGO SHIP

               It's NIGHT. RAIN POURS down. We're in the middle of a violent 
               STORM AT SEA. Thirty-foot waves crash across the deck.

               The TWO PORTUGUESE SAILORS (who have Indy's arms pinned behind 
               his back) propel Indy across the deck toward the rail.

               As they pass a BUNDLE OF FUEL DRUMS, Indy uses the Two Sailors 
               as leverage to KICK UP HIS FEET and break open the CLAMP on 
               the metal bands that hold the drums together.

               Indy jabs his elbows into the stomachs of the startled Sailors 
               and rushes toward the Man In The Panama Hat.

               Panama Hat sees Indy coming and hurries toward the ladder 
               that leads up to the bridge. Indy withstands the force of 
               waves crashing on the deck and makes his way to where Panama 
               Hat is climbing the ladder. He pulls him off the ladder from 
               behind the two men fall down on the deck. Indy takes the 
               cross back from Panama Hat.

               A sailor delivers a powerful blow to Indy's face, sending 
               the cross flying out of his grip and skittering across the 
               deck. Indy grabs a crowbar and fends off two sailors who 
               attack him from the sides.

               Indy sees that the Cross is about to be swept overboard. He 
               lunges for it.

               He SNATCHES UP the Cross only to be knocked down to the deck 
               by a giant wave. He struggles to his feet, managing to avoid 
               the giant fuel drums sliding across the deck around him.

               SEVERAL MORE DRUMS come Indy's way. He sidesteps them all.

                                     PANAMA HAT
                         Grab him, he's getting away! Grab 
                         him!

               Indy turns around and pummels two sailors with one punch. 
               Indy sees a large Stevedore's hook above him and he climbs 
               up on crates to reach it. He grabs a hold of the hook and 
               uses it to swing all the way across the deck, narrowly 
               avoiding a huge wave behind him. He jumps into the rollicking 
               ocean, still holding onto the cross. On the ship, a giant 
               fuel drum rolls wildly, falling directly onto a crate of 
               TNT. The crate explodes, causing the entire ship to blow, 
               sending an enormous orange fireball into the sky.

               LONG SHOT - THE BOAT EXPLODING OUT OF THE WATER

               As bits of debris fall from the sky like rain.

               Indy BOBS UP in the water amid the debris, holding the Cross 
               in his hand. He grabs for something to keep him afloat. It 
               turns out to be one of the ship's LIFE PRESERVERS. Indy loops 
               his arm through the preserver.

               Only now do we see the FADED LETTERING on the preserver 
               revealing the destroyed ship's name and city of port: "VAZQUEZ 
               de CORONADO BARCELONA"

               A SHREDDED PANAMA HAT floats past.

               EXT. COLLEGE - DAY

               Students walk along brick, tree-lined paths.

                                     INDY (V.O.)
                         Archaeology is...

               INT. COLLEGE LECTURE HALL - DAY

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INDY

               Dressed in professorial tweeds, stands before his class. He 
               turns to the blackboard with a piece of chalk and writes the 
               word: "FACT."

                                     INDY
                         ...the search for fact. Not truth. 
                         If it's truth you're interested in, 
                         Doctor Tyree's Philosophy class is 
                         right down the hall.

               Laughter.

               INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

                                     INDY
                         So forget any ideas you've got about 
                         lost cities, exotic travel, and 
                         digging up the world. You do not 
                         follow maps to buried treasure and 
                         "X" never, ever, marks the spot.

               MARCUS BRODY approaches Indy's classroom. He peers through 
               the window in the door to see Indy completing his lecture.

                                     INDY
                         Seventy percent of all archaeology 
                         is done in the library. Research. 
                         Reading.

               INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

               Brody enters the lecture hall and stands at the rear of the 
               room.

                                     INDY
                         We cannot afford to take mythology 
                         at face value.

               The BELL RINGS. Indy stands at his desk as students begin to 
               disperse. A pretty coed puts a note on the desk.

                                     INDY
                         Next week: "Egyptology." Starting 
                         with the excavation of Naukratis by 
                         Blinders Petrie in 1885. I will be 
                         in my office if anybody's got any 
                         problems for the next hour and a 
                         half.

               Brody approaches as the last of the students leaves the 
               lecture hall.

                                     INDY
                         Marcus!
                              (slaps his pocket)
                         I did it!

                                     BRODY
                         You've got it!

               Indy removes the cloth-wrapped Cross from his desk. He places 
               it on the desk and takes off his glasses as Brody examines 
               the Cross.

                                     INDY
                         You know how long I've been looking 
                         for that?!

                                     BRODY
                         All your life.

                                     INDY
                         All my life!

                                     BRODY
                         Well done, Indy. Very well done, 
                         indeed. This will find a place of 
                         honor in our Spanish collection.

               Indy gathers up his books and makes his way toward the door.

                                     INDY
                         We can discuss my honorarium over 
                         dinner and champagne tonight.

               He turns back toward Brody, now holding the Cross.

                                     INDY
                         Your treat.

                                     BRODY
                         Yes. My treat.

               INT. INDY'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

               Bursting with STUDENTS, all competing for his attention at 
               once: "Professor Jones!" "Doctor Jones!" etc., etc.

                                     INDY
                         Shush! Shush! Shush!

               Indy shoulders his way to the desk of his secretary, an 
               overwhelmed Teaching Assistant named IRENE.

                                     IRENE
                         Doctor Jones! I'm so glad you're 
                         back! Your mail is on your desk. 
                         Here are your phone messages.

                                     MALE STUDENT
                         Doctor Jones, you promised... Doctor 
                         Jones --

                                     IRENE
                         This is your appointment schedule. 
                         And these term papers still haven't 
                         been graded.

               Indy takes the term papers then turns to enter his PRIVATE 
               OFFICE. Students once again CLAMOR for his attention: "Doctor 
               Jones!" "Wait, Doctor Jones!" "My grade!" "Sign my 
               registration card!"

               Indy silences the mob with a raised hand.

                                     INDY
                              (very efficiently)
                         Okay. Irene, put everyone's name on 
                         a list, in the order they arrived, 
                         and I'll see each and every one of 
                         them in turn.

               The Students descend upon poor Irene, each claiming to be 
               first. Indy slips into his --

               PRIVATE OFFICE

               Where he goes to his desk and finds a thick envelope with a 
               foreign postmark on it.

                                     INDY
                              (softly; reading)
                         "Venice, Italy."

               Then, Indy stuffs his mail into his coat pockets, goes to 
               the WINDOW, slides it open and STEPS OUT INTO THE GARDEN.

               EXT. SIDE OF COLLEGE BUILDING - DAY

               Indy escapes through the garden.

               EXT. FRONT OF COLLEGE BUILDING - DAY

               Indy walks briskly toward the street; smiling, enjoying his 
               freedom. As he arrives at the curb, a LONG BLACK PACKARD 
               SEDAN pulls up before him.

                                     MAN (O.S.)
                         Doctor Jones!

               THREE MEN step out of the sedan. Everything about them 
               bespeaks "G-MAN." The First Man steps behind Indy.

                                     MAN
                         Doctor Jones?

               INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - DAY

               Indy is ushered into a large Art Deco apartment and left 
               alone. Numerous museum-quality artifacts are displayed around 
               the room. Indy takes this opportunity to examine them.

               After a moment, WALTER DONOVAN enters from across the room. 
               During the brief time that the door is open, we HEAR a 
               COCKTAIL PARTY going on in the next room: VOICES and SOFT 
               PIANO MUSIC.

               Donovan strides across the room toward Indy. Although in his 
               late fifties, Donovan has the broad shoulders and trim 
               physique of a much younger man. Dressed in a tuxedo, he exudes 
               both confidence and power.

                                     DONOVAN
                         I trust your trip down was 
                         comfortable, Doctor Jones. My men 
                         didn't alarm you, I hope.

               He shakes hands with Indy.

                                     DONOVAN
                         My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.

                                     INDY
                         I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your 
                         contributions to the museum over the 
                         years have been extremely generous. 
                         Some of the pieces in your collection 
                         here are very impressive.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I 
                         have a passion for antiquities.
                              (beat)
                         Have a look over here. This might 
                         interest you.

               Donovan goes to a table where an object is wrapped in cloth. 
               He throws back the cloth revealing a flat STONE TABLET -- 
               about two feet square, inscribed with letters and symbols.

               Indy looks impressed. He puts on his glasses to make a closer 
               examination.

                                     INDY
                         Well, it's sandstone. Christian 
                         symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth 
                         Century, I should think.

                                     DONOVAN
                         That was our assessment as well.

                                     INDY
                         Where did this come from?

                                     DONOVAN
                         My engineers unearthed it in the 
                         mountain region north of Ankara while 
                         excavating for copper.
                              (beat)
                         Can you translate the inscription?

               Translating the inscription is no easy matter, even for 
               someone as knowledgeable as Indy.

                                     INDY
                              (stumbling through it)
                         "...who drinks the water I shall 
                         give him, says the Lord, will have a 
                         spring inside him welling up for 
                         eternal life. Let them bring me to 
                         your holy mountain in the place where 
                         you dwell.

               Donovan pours champagne into several fluted glasses as Indy 
               reads.

                                     INDY

                         Moon, to the Temple where the cup 
                         that --"

               Suddenly Indy stops and looks up at Donovan with a startled 
               expression.

                                     INDY
                         "Where the cup that holds the blood 
                         of Jesus Christ resides forever."

                                     DONOVAN
                              (reverently)
                         The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The 
                         chalice used by Christ during the 
                         Last Supper. The cup that caught His 
                         blood at the Crucifixion and was 
                         entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.

               Indy rubs his chin with a dubious expression as he takes the 
               glass of champagne Donovan now offers him.

                                     INDY
                         The Arthur Legend. I've heard this 
                         bedtime story before.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift 
                         of youth to whoever drinks from the 
                         Grail.
                              (beat)
                         Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd 
                         like to wake up to!

                                     INDY
                         An old man's dream.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Every man's dream.
                              (beat)
                         Including your father's, I believe.

               Indy stiffens slightly at the mention of his father, nods.

                                     INDY
                         Grail lore is his hobby. He's a 
                         teacher of Medieval Literature. The 
                         one the students hope they don't 
                         get.

               The door opens and MRS. DONOVAN steps into the room. She's a 
               matronly woman in an expensive evening gown.

                                     MRS. DONOVAN
                         Walter, you're neglecting our guests.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Be along in a moment, dear.

               He leans over and kisses her cheek. Mrs. Donovan sighs to 
               herself and returns to the party. Indy, meanwhile, has turned 
               his attention back to the Grail Tablet, obviously hooked by 
               its archaeological promise. He moistens his finger with 
               champagne and rubs it over the Tablet. Donovan steps up next 
               to Indy.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy 
                         Grail's final resting place described 
                         in detail!

                                     INDY
                         What good is it? This Grail Tablet 
                         speaks of deserts and mountains and 
                         canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you 
                         start looking? Maybe if the Tablet 
                         were intact, you'd have something to 
                         go on. But the entire top portion is 
                         missing.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Just the same, an attempt to recover 
                         the Grail is currently underway.

               Indy has to shake his head at Donovan's apparent lack of 
               judgment.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Let me tell you another "bedtime 
                         story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail 
                         was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, 
                         it disappeared and was lost for a 
                         thousand years before it was found 
                         again by three Knights of the First 
                         Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.

                                     INDY
                         I've heard this one as well. Two of 
                         these brothers walked out of the 
                         desert one hundred and fifty years 
                         after having found the Grail and 
                         began the long journey back to France. 
                         But only one of them made it. And 
                         before dying of extreme old age, he 
                         supposedly imparted his tale to a -- 
                         to a Franciscan friar, I think.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Not "supposedly," Doctor Jones.

               Donovan produces an ANCIENT LEATHER-BOUND VOLUME with very 
               brittle pages. Indy views the manuscript with considerable 
               interest.

                                     DONOVAN
                         This is the manuscript in which the 
                         friar chronicled the Knight's story... 
                         it doesn't reveal on location of the 
                         Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight 
                         promised that two "markers" that had 
                         been left behind would.
                              (indicates the Tablet)
                         This Tablet is one of those "markers." 
                         It proves the Knight's story is true. 
                         But as you pointed out -- it's 
                         incomplete.
                              (beat)
                         Now, the second "marker" is entombed 
                         with the Knight's dead brother. Our 
                         project leader believes that tomb to 
                         be located within the city of Venice, 
                         Italy.
                              (beat)
                         As you can now see, Doctor Jones, 
                         we're about to complete a great quest 
                         that began almost two thousand years 
                         ago. We're only one step away.

                         That's usually when the ground falls 
                         out from underneath your feet.

                                     DONOVAN
                         You could be more right than you 
                         know.

                                     INDY
                         Yes?

                                     DONOVAN
                         We've hit a snag. Our project leader 
                         has vanished. Along with all his 
                         research. Uh, we received a cable 
                         from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, 
                         who has no idea of his whereabouts 
                         or what's become of him.
                              (beat)
                         I want you to pick up the trail where 
                         he left off. Find the man and you 
                         will find the Grail.

                                     INDY
                         You've got the wrong Jones, Mister 
                         Donovan. Why don't you try my father?

                                     DONOVAN
                              (after a pause)
                         We already have. Your father is the 
                         man who's disappeared.

               EXT. A RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

               A FORD COUPE speeds down the tree-lined street.

               EXT. PROFESSOR HENRY JONES' HOUSE - DAY

               The Ford coupe pulls up in front of the house. Indy climbs 
               from the car and hurries up the walkway. Brody is a step 
               behind.

                                     BRODY
                         Your father and I have been friends 
                         since time began. I've watched you 
                         grow up, Indy. And I've watched the 
                         two of you grow apart.
                              (beat)
                         I've never seen you this concerned 
                         about him before.

               They climb the porch and notice that the front door is ajar. 
               They exchange a quick look of concern as they enter.

               INT. THE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

               Indy approaches the half-open front door.

                                     INDY
                         Dad?
                              (to Brody)
                         He's an academic A bookworm. He's 
                         not a field man.

               He pushes open the door. He enters the house and calls out.

                                     INDY
                         Dad? Dad?

               Indy opens one half of the curtains dividing the hall from 
               the sitting room.

               We see the place has been ransacked.

               Brody sees Indy's face and opens the other half.

                                     BRODY
                         Dear God.

               They walk into the room.

                                     BRODY
                         What has the old fool got himself 
                         into now?

                                     INDY
                         I don't know. But whatever it is, 
                         he's in over his head!

               Brody picks up some mail from Henry's cluttered desk.

                                     INDY
                         Dad?

                                     BRODY
                         It's today's mail. And it's been 
                         opened.

               Indy turns and sees the pile of torn papers and envelopes. 
               Then something hits him.

                                     INDY
                         Mail! That's it, Marcus!

               He immediately empties his pockets of his own mail taken 
               earlier in the day from his college office and finds the 
               envelope with the Venice postmark.

                                     INDY
                              (as he tears it open)
                         Venice, Italy!

                                     BRODY
                         What is it?

               Indy uncovers a small book. It looks like a JOURNAL or DIARY. 
               Indy flips through it: Page after page of handwritten notes 
               and drawings. Brody glances at it with great curiosity.

                                     INDY
                         It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue 
                         he ever followed. Every discovery he 
                         made. A complete record of his search 
                         for the Holy Grail. This is his whole 
                         life. Why would he have sent this to 
                         me?

                                     BRODY
                         I don't know. But someone must want 
                         it pretty badly.

                                     INDY
                         Do you believe, Marcus?

               As Indy asks the question, he turns to a PAINTING on the 
               wall: A depiction of Christ on the Cross, his blood being 
               captured in a golden chalice.

               A SECOND PAINTING on the wall shows Eleventh Century Crusaders 
               plummeting to their deaths over a high cliff. One Crusader, 
               however, floats safely in midair because he holds the Grail 
               in his hands.

                                     INDY
                         Do you believe the Grail actually 
                         exists?

                                     BRODY
                         The search for the Cup of Christ is 
                         the search for the divine in all of 
                         us.

               Brody sees that Indy is unsatisfied by this response.

                                     BRODY
                         But if you want facts, Indy, I have 
                         none to give you. At my age, I'm 
                         prepared to take a few things on 
                         faith.

                                     INDY
                         Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll 
                         take that ticket to Venice now.

                                     BRODY
                         I'll tell him we'll take two.

               EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY

               A LIMO is parked beside a PRIVATE AIRLINER that bears the 
               DONOVAN CORPORATE LOGO. Brody peers inside to Donovan and 
               Indy.

                                     BRODY
                         Tell me, what's going to happen when 
                         we get to Venice?

                                     DONOVAN
                              (overlapping)
                         Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will 
                         be there to meet you.

                                     BRODY
                              (overlapping)
                         Schneider?

                                     DONOVAN
                              (overlapping)
                         I maintain an apartment in Venice, 
                         at your disposal.

                                     BRODY
                         Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.

               Brody and Donovan shake hands. Indy steps from the back seat 
               of the limo. He turns back to Donovan and shakes his hand.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Doctor Jones. Good luck. Be very 
                         careful. Don't trust anybody.

               INT. AIRLINER - FLYING - DAY

               Indy opens the Grail Diary and thoughtfully turns through 
               the pages. He stops at one page and glances at a PENCIL SKETCH 
               of what might be a stained-glass window. Below the sketch is 
               a SERIES OF NUMBERS.

               EXT. THE PRIVATE AIRLINER - FLYING - DAY

               SUPERIMPOSED over a MAP that traces a course from New York 
               City to Venice, Italy.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. VENICE - BOAT LANDING - DAY

               Indy and Brody disembark from the Water Bus onto the Boat 
               Landing as other Gondoliers steer their boats in the water.

                                     INDY
                         Ah, Venice...

                                     BRODY
                         Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this 
                         Doctor Schneider when we see him?

                                     INDY
                         I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.

               Suddenly a WOMAN comes up to him. Attractive features. Blonde 
               hair. Eyes that are bright and intelligent.

                                     ELSA
                         Doctor Jones?

                                     INDY
                         Yes?

                                     ELSA
                         I knew it was you --

               She looks at him with an appraising expression that is 
               brazenly flirtatious.

                                     ELSA
                         You have your father's eyes.

               Indy is instantly attracted to her.

                                     INDY
                         And my mother's ears. But the rest 
                         belongs to you.

                                     ELSA
                         Looks like the best parts have already 
                         been spoken for.

               Indy grins, enjoying the repartee. The Woman turns to Brody, 
               who tips his hat.

                                     ELSA
                         Marcus Brody?

                                     BRODY
                         That's right.

               The Woman, DR. ELSA SCHNEIDER, extends her hand to Brody.

                                     ELSA
                              (introducing herself)
                         Doctor Elsa Schneider.

               Indy's grin fades. Brody registers a look of surprise.

                                     BRODY
                         Uh... how do you do?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. VENICE CANAL - DAY

               Indy, Brody and Elsa walk along the narrow canal, lined with 
               buildings on either side.

                                     ELSA
                         The last time I saw your father we 
                         were in the library. He was very 
                         close to tracking down the Knight's 
                         Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. 
                         He was as giddy as a schoolboy.

                                     INDY
                         Who? Attila the Professor? He was 
                         never giddy, even when he was a 
                         schoolboy!

               Indy can't take his eyes off Elsa. Perhaps he's feeling a 
               bit like a schoolboy himself right now. As they cross over a 
               bridge to the opposite side of the canal, Indy steals a flower 
               from a street vendor. He holds it out to Elsa.

                                     INDY
                         Fraulein -- will you permit me?

                                     ELSA
                         I usually don't.

                                     INDY
                         I usually don't either.

                                     ELSA
                         In that case, I permit you.

               Indy gives her the flower.

                                     INDY
                         It would make me very happy.

                                     ELSA
                         But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow 
                         it will have faded.

                                     INDY
                         Tomorrow I'll steal you another.

                                     BRODY
                              (cutting in)
                         I hate to interrupt you -- but the 
                         reason we're here --

                                     ELSA
                              (interrupting)
                         Yes. I have something to show you.

               She hands a slip of paper to Indy.

                                     ELSA
                         I left your father working in the 
                         library. He sent me to the map section 
                         to fetch an ancient plan of the city. 
                         When I got back to his table -- he'd 
                         gone -- with all his papers -- except 
                         for that scrap which I found near 
                         his chair.

               Indy extends the scrap of paper to Brody.

                                     INDY
                         Roman numerals.

               EXT. VENICE PIAZZA - DAY

               Elsa leads Indy and Brody into the large piazza. People walk 
               about and sit at tables in front of a large building.

                                     ELSA
                         Here is the library.

               They have arrived at the front steps of the library.

                                     INDY
                         That doesn't look much like a library.

                                     BRODY
                         It looks like a converted church.

               Elsa leads the way inside.

               INT. THE LIBRARY - DAY

               Indy, Brody and Elsa enter, their heels CLICKING across the 
               marble floor.

               We notice, along with Indy and Brody, that the library 
               contains many stained-glass windows.

                                     ELSA
                         In this case it's the literal truth. 
                         We're on holy ground. These columns 
                         over here...

               She indicates FOUR HUGE MARBLE COLUMNS that go from floor to 
               ceiling.

                                     ELSA
                         ...were brought back as spoils of 
                         war after the sacking of Byzantium 
                         during the Crusades.

               Indy glances at the Columns, then notices a stained-glass 
               Window that depicts a Knight of the Crusades. Indy lingers 
               for a moment in front of the window.

                                     ELSA
                         Now please excuse me. The library's 
                         closing in a few moments. I'll arrange 
                         for us to stay a little longer.

               The minute Elsa is out of earshot.

                                     INDY
                         Marcus -- I've seen this window 
                         before.

                                     BRODY
                         Where?

               Indy whips out the Grail Diary and opens it to the sketch he 
               noticed in the airplane.

                                     INDY
                         Right here. In Dad's Diary. You see?

               Brody glances at the Diary, then at the window -- noticing 
               that the Roman numerals in question have been worked into 
               the window's design.

                                     BRODY
                         Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!

                                     INDY
                         Dad was onto something here!

                                     BRODY
                         Well, now we know the source of the 
                         numbers, but we still don't know 
                         what they mean.

               Indy and Brody now see Elsa approaching. Indy quickly tucks 
               the Diary back into his pocket.

                                     INDY
                              (explaining to Brody)
                         My dad sent me this Diary for a 
                         reason. Until we find out why, I 
                         suggest we keep it to ourselves.

                                     ELSA
                         Find something?

               Indy doesn't reply. He's looking in five directions at once. 
               His eyes moving across the walls and ceilings -- charged 
               with the thrill of discovery.

                                     BRODY
                              (to Elsa)
                         Uh, yes. Three, seven and ten. That 
                         window seems to be the source of the 
                         Roman numerals.

                                     ELSA
                         My God, I must be blind

                                     INDY
                         Dad wasn't looking for a book about 
                         the Knight's Tomb... he was looking 
                         for the Tomb itself

               Elsa wears a blank expression.

                                     INDY
                         Don't you get it? The Tomb is 
                         somewhere in the library! You said 
                         yourself it used to be a church! 
                         Look.

               Indy's eyes travel up one of the four huge marble columns.

                                     INDY
                         Three.

               Indy looks again to the stained-glass window. He points.

                                     INDY
                         Three!

               Indy has discovered that each Column is numbered with a Roman 
               Numeral. Indy hurries away toward Column VII. All Brody and 
               Elsa can do now is try to keep up with him.

                                     INDY
                         Seven.

               He points again to the stained-glass window.

                                     INDY
                         Seven... Ten.

               He looks down to the scrap of paper in his hands.

                                     INDY
                         And ten. Now where's the ten? Look 
                         around for the ten.

               Indy walks past aisles of book-lined shelves. He stops, turns, 
               then looks down.

                                     INDY
                         Three, seven and ten.

               He climbs a spiral staircase leading up to a LOFT and looks 
               down at Brody and Elsa. The floor beneath their feet is an 
               elaborate tile design containing a huge "X" -- visible only 
               from this higher angle.

                                     INDY
                         Ten.
                              (wryly; to himself)
                         "X" marks the spot.

               Indy rushes down the staircase and goes to the CENTER TILE 
               where the two sides of the X intersect. He blows dust away 
               from the tile and tries to pry it up, but cannot.

               Indy rushes past Brody to a cordon held in place by a brass 
               stand underneath the stained-glass window.

               Indy raises the brass stand and timing his actions, hits the 
               tile precisely as the Librarian stamps a book. The Librarian 
               regards the stamper curiously.

               Indy continues to pound at the tile as the Librarian resumes 
               his stamping, still puzzled by the SOUND ECHOING through the 
               library.

               Finally Indy breaks the tile. As he bends to remove the pieces 
               of broken tile, a TWO-FOOT SQUARE HOLE IS REVEALED.

               Cold air and a wet, rancid smell escape from the hole.

                                     INDY
                         Bingo.

                                     ELSA
                         You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. 
                         You're a great deal like your father.

                                     INDY
                         Except he's lost, and I'm not.

                                     ELSA
                         Lower me down.

               Indy is impressed with Elsa's spirit, and cooperates agreeably -- 
               holding her by the hands and lowering her into the hole. 
               When her feet finally touch ground below, Indy releases his 
               grip on her and slips the Grail Diary to Brody.

                                     INDY
                         Look after this for me, will you?

               Then Indy disappears into the hole.

               INT. CATACOMBS BELOW LIBRARY - DAY

               Indy jumps down a steep step. He reaches back to help Elsa.

                                     INDY
                         Come on.

               Indy and Elsa glance around. This is really a horrid place. 
               Dark and dank. Foul smelling. Elsa turns. She removes a 
               cigarette lighter with a unique ivory four-leaf clover design.

               Indy and Elsa inspect markings carved onto the walls.

                                     ELSA
                         Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth 
                         Century.

                                     INDY
                         Right. Six hundred years before the 
                         Crusades.

                                     ELSA
                         The Christians would have dug their 
                         own passages and burial chambers 
                         centuries later.

               Indy takes the lighter from her and lights their way down a 
               dark passageway.

                                     INDY
                         That's right. If there's a Knight of 
                         the First Crusade entombed down here, 
                         that's where we'll find him.

               INT. LIBRARY - DAY

               THREE MEN carrying guns make their way down the spiral 
               staircase toward an unsuspecting Brody. One of the Men, KAZIM, 
               raises his gun and brings it down hard on Brody's head.

                                     BRODY
                         Ohhhh...

               Kazim gestures with his gun toward the now-unconscious Brody. 
               The other two men take Brody's hands and drag him into one 
               of the book-lined aisles.

               INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS - DAY

               DECOMPOSING CORPSES rest in niches carved into the stone 
               walls. Grotesque skeletal remains with rotting linen stretched 
               across blackened bones.

               Indy holds the lighter up as he and Elsa inspect symbols 
               carved into the walls.

               Elsa spots a symbol cut into the wall that she doesn't 
               recognize. As she blows away some cobwebs:

                                     ELSA
                         What's this one?

               Indy only has to give it a quick glance to know.

                                     INDY
                         The Ark of the Covenant.

                                     ELSA
                         Are you sure?

                                     INDY
                              (deadpan)
                         Pretty sure.

               Indy holds the lighter up and he and Elsa enter another dark 
               passageway.

               ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS

               Indy steps to the wall and runs his hand over the stone. He 
               scrapes the cobwebs away to reveal the ROMAN NUMERAL "X."

                                     INDY
                         Watch out.

               Elsa now holds the lighter as Indy rams his shoulder into 
               the wall. The wall collapses on impact and Indy falls through 
               into another room.

               ANOTHER ROOM - THE CATACOMBS

               As Indy falls through the hole in the wall onto rocks 
               surrounded by bubbling, green, slimy liquid. More skeletons 
               surround him, resting in their carved niches. Elsa holds the 
               lighter as she peers in at him through the hole in the wall.

                                     INDY
                         Petroleum. I could sink a well down 
                         here and retire.

               Indy reaches up and tears a piece of cloth from one of the 
               skeletons, which breaks apart and falls into the oil-slick 
               water.

               Indy uses the scrap of cloth and a bone to fashion a crude 
               torch, which he then dips into the oily water.

                                     INDY
                         Give me the lighter.

               ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS

               Using the cloth-wrapped bone torch to guide their way, Indy 
               and Elsa come upon a NARROW PASSAGEWAY. The water is knee-
               deep and TEEMING WITH RATS. Thousands of them crawling on 
               one another's backs. SQUEALING. Squirming. Thrashing in the 
               water.

                                     INDY
                         Oh, rats...

               Elsa gasps as the rats scamper between her legs.

               Indy moves forward through the rat-infested water as Elsa 
               follows, still gasping in horror. Suddenly he slips into a 
               hole. Recovering his balance, he reaches out to Elsa.

                                     INDY
                         Come on!

               She gasps once again, terrified. Indy lifts her and carries 
               Elsa as he moves forward.

               THE CATACOMBS - THE HOLE IN THE WALL

               Kazim and his men step to the opening Indy made earlier and 
               shine their flashlights through to the rat-infested water.

               ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS

               More rat-infested water as Elsa, now walking again, follows 
               Indy through another passageway lined with skulls and bones.

               Indy reaches for a wall to steady himself and inadvertently 
               grabs a skeleton. A bone comes loose in his hand as rats 
               scurry about and leap at him from all directions.

               He takes a moment to compose himself, then steps across the 
               water to Elsa's side. He steps into the water, then reaches 
               up to help Elsa do the same.

                                     INDY
                         Come here.

               LARGE BURIAL CHAMBER

               The chamber is flooded with black, briny water.

                                     INDY
                         Look...

               In the center of the chamber, jutting up above the water, is 
               what amounts to an "island altar" on which SEVERAL ANCIENT 
               COFFINS rest. They move toward the altar.

               Indy and Elsa begin to inspect the ornately carved COFFINS 
               like the scholars of antiquity that they are. These are big 
               oak caskets held together by straps of etched brass.

                                     INDY
                         It must be one of these...

                                     ELSA
                         Look at the artistry of these carvings 
                         and the scrollwork.

               One coffin is elevated above the others.

                                     ELSA
                         It's this one.

               Together they begin to push on the lid -- STRAINING and 
               GROANING until it slides away and BANGS against the stone 
               platform.

               INSIDE THE COFFIN

               Lie the DECOMPOSED REMAINS of a KNIGHT IN ARMOR. Indy and 
               Elsa look in... Elsa gasps.

                                     INDY
                         This is it! We found it! Look -- the 
                         engraving on the shield. It's the 
                         same as on the Grail Tablets. The 
                         shield is the second marker!

               Indy unfolds a piece of paper and holds it over the shield.

                                     ELSA
                         What's that?

                                     INDY
                         It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail 
                         Tablet.

               The missing portion of the rubbing is completed by the shield.

                                     ELSA
                         Just like your father -- giddy as a 
                         schoolboy.

               Indy laughs.

                                     ELSA
                         Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were 
                         here now to see this?

                                     INDY
                              (chuckles)
                         He never would have made it past the 
                         rats! He hates rats! He's scared to 
                         death of them!

               CLOSE - A HAND

               As it lights a match.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL KAZIM

               Dropping the lighted match into the oil-slick water.

               INDY AND ELSA

               Elsa holds the torch. Indy looks around. Listens. Something 
               is wrong. And then he sees the GLOW OF FIRELIGHT dancing 
               across the Catacomb walls.

               This is followed by THOUSANDS OF RATS FLEEING from around 
               the corner of the Narrow Passageway, STAMPEDING toward Elsa 
               and Indy -- SHRIEKING and SQUEALING as they approach.

               The rats literally wash over them -- like a rodent tidal 
               wave -- in their efforts to escape a:

               HUGE ORANGE BALL OF FIRE

               ROARING around the corner hurtling towards them -- feeding 
               on the oil slick; consuming the oxygen.

               Elsa SCREAMS.

                                     INDY
                         Get back! Back against the wall.

               Indy braces his back against the altar and TOPPLES THE COFFIN 
               with his feet. It CRASHES against the stone platform and 
               SPLASHES into the water.

                                     INDY
                         Quick! Under it!

               They jump into the water beside the bobbing, overturned 
               coffin.

                                     INDY
                         Air pocket!

               Elsa hesitates. Indy literally DUNKS her and pushes her 
               underneath.

               UNDER THE COFFIN

               Elsa surfaces into the air pocket created by the coffin, 
               SPUTTERING and SPITTING.

               Now Indy pops up into the air pocket. He looks at Elsa -- 
               they are both soaking wet.

                                     INDY
                         Don't wander off.

                                     ELSA
                         What?

               Indy disappears under the water and swims out from under the 
               coffin.

                                     ELSA
                         What?

               UNDER THE WATER

               Indy swims, looking for an escape route.

               UNDER THE COFFIN

               The rats are beginning to force their way inside, swimming 
               through the water and climbing on Elsa, who squirms and 
               screams in terror.

               Indy pops back up through the water.

                                     INDY
                         I think I've found a way out. Deep 
                         breath.

               Elsa groans. They take a deep breath and both dive under the 
               water.

               EXT. VENICE PIAZZA - OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY

               The perfect picture postcard -- St. Mark's Square and the 
               Grand Canal beyond. Cafe customers are startled to see Indy 
               and Elsa climb out of the sewer, wet and smelly. Indy looks 
               around at the postcard-perfect setting and smiles.

                                     INDY
                              (wryly)
                         Ah, Venice!

               Indy's delight, however, is short-lived since Kazim and TWO 
               OTHER TURKISH AGENTS are running towards them with drawn 
               guns.

               He grabs Elsa by the hand and the two of them run down the 
               dock and LEAP INTO A MOTORBOAT.

               INT. THE MOTORBOAT - DAY

               Indy fires up the engine and pulls away from the dock... but 
               not before a TURKISH AGENT JUMPS in with him.

               Elsa grabs the wheel and begins to steer the boat while Indy 
               and the Turk trade punches.

               EXT. THE HARBOR - DAY

               Indy's Speedboat BOUNCES across the choppy waters heading in 
               the direction of the DOCKED STEAMSHIP.

               Kazim and his men rush to TWO MORE SPEEDBOATS tied to the 
               dock.

               They chase after Indy.

               Indy grapples with the Turkish Agent. As Indy grips his arms, 
               we SEE a GUN in the Agent's hand. It FIRES.

               As Indy fights with the Turk, he becomes aware of the 
               Speedboats behind him and two enormous Freighters ahead of 
               him, joined together by two giant ropes.

               Indy, having gained the advantage, leans on top of the Turkish 
               Agent.

                                     INDY
                              (to Elsa)
                         Are you crazy?! You don't go between 
                         them!

               Elsa can barely hear Indy over the noise of the motor.

                                     ELSA
                         Go between them? Are you crazy?!

               Indy finally delivers the punch that sends the Turkish Agent 
               flying overboard. Turning, Indy sees that Elsa has committed 
               the speedboat to a course BETWEEN the two Freighters, now 
               being pushed even closer together by a Tugboat.

                                     INDY
                         I said go around!

                                     ELSA
                         You said go between them!

                                     INDY
                         I said don't go between them!

               It's purely academic at this point since the hulls of the 
               two Freighters loom up on either side of them like cavern 
               walls.

               EXT. FULL SHOT - THE HARBOR - DAY

               One Enemy Speedboat chases Indy between the two Freighters. 
               But the Speedboat containing Kazim veers off and goes around.

               EXT. BETWEEN THE TWO FREIGHTERS - DAY

               It's a race for daylight as the two Freighters drift ever 
               closer to one another.

               Indy's Speedboat just manages to squeeze through the gap. 
               But the Enemy Speedboat EXPLODES as it is crushed between 
               the two Freighters, FLYING INTO THE AIR and SPLASHING back 
               down into the water.

               INDY AND ELSA

               Spin their boat around in a sharp half-circle to see KAZIM'S 
               SPEEDBOAT appear racing toward them. He stands in the moving 
               boat, FIRING A MACHINE GUN at Indy and Elsa.

               KAZIM'S SPEEDBOAT

               Matches Indy's move for move.

               FULL SHOT - THE HARBOR

               The two boats race across the water nearly side-by-side. A 
               CHATTERING MACHINE GUN from Kazim's boat SPLINTERS the wood 
               of Indy's boat, until finally the rear of the boat CATCHES 
               ON FIRE.

               The machine gun runs out of ammunition. Kazim puts it down 
               and takes control of the wheel from one of the Turkish Agents 
               in the boat with him.

               As Indy's boat drifts toward the GIANT, TURNING PROPELLERS 
               at the STERN of ANOTHER STEAMER, Kazim's boat draws up 
               alongside and hits them. Indy steps into Kazim's boat. He 
               knocks one of the Turkish Agents to the deck, then turns his 
               attention to Kazim. The two men trade punches as the boat 
               spins helplessly in the churning water.

                                     ELSA
                         No!!

               Indy kicks Kazim in the face, knocking him into the water, 
               then pulls him back into the boat, now being SUCKED THROUGH 
               THE CHURNING WATER toward the Steamer's giant propeller 
               blades.

                                     INDY
                         Why are you trying to kill us?

                                     KAZIM
                         Because you're looking for the Holy 
                         Grail.

                                     INDY
                         My father was looking for the Holy 
                         Grail. Did you kill him too?

                                     KAZIM
                         No.

                                     INDY
                         Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. 
                         Damn it, tell me! Tell me!

                                     KAZIM
                         If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, 
                         we'll both die.

                                     INDY
                         Then we'll die.

                                     KAZIM
                         My soul is prepared. How's yours?

               By now half the boat has been chopped up into matchwood and 
               the blades are getting closer.

                                     INDY
                         This is your last chance.

                                     KAZIM
                         No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!

               The wind of the blades is on their necks. Indy grabs Kazim 
               just in time and jumps... into the motorboat, driven by Elsa, 
               which gets alongside in the nick of time.

                                     INDY
                         All right! Where's my father

                                     KAZIM
                         If you let me go, I will tell you 
                         where he is.

                                     INDY
                         Who are you?

                                     KAZIM
                         My name is Kazim.

                                     INDY
                         And why were you trying to kill me?

                                     KAZIM
                         The secret of the Grail has been 
                         safe for a thousand years. And for 
                         all that time the Brotherhood of the 
                         Cruciform Sword has been prepared to 
                         do anything to keep it safe.

               Kazim pulls back his shirt to reveal a birthmark... or is it 
               a tattoo? Whatever it is, it's a cruciform sword; a Christian 
               cross which tapers down, like the blades of a broadsword.

                                     KAZIM
                         Let me get off at this jetty.

               The boat is close to the edge of the canal. Indy gives Elsa 
               a nod, telling her to bring the boat in. Kazim steps ashore.

                                     KAZIM
                         Ask yourself, why do you seek the 
                         Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, 
                         or for yours?

                                     INDY
                         I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. 
                         I came to find my father.

                                     KAZIM
                         In that case, God be with you in 
                         your quest. Your father is being 
                         held in the Castle of Brunwald on 
                         the Austrian-German border.

               Kazim walks away.

               INT. VENICE APARTMENT - DAY

               CLOSE ON THE WATER-SOAKED PAPER IMPRESSION: The rubbing taken 
               from the shield of the Grail Knight.

               Brody is giving it careful study while he dabs the lump on 
               the back of his head with an ice pack.

                                     INDY
                         How's the head?

                                     BRODY
                         It's better, now I've seen this. 
                         It's the name of a city. 
                         "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...

               Indy, wearing a bathrobe, leans over to study the impression.

                                     INDY
                         The Knights of the First Crusade 
                         laid siege to the city of Alexandretta 
                         for over a year. The entire city was 
                         destroyed.

               Brody lowers the ice pack from his head and looks at Indy.

                                     INDY
                         The present city of Iskenderun is 
                         built on its ruins. Marcus -- you 
                         remember what the Grail Tablet said. 
                         "Across the desert and through the 
                         mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent 
                         Moon."
                              (pause)
                         But where exactly?

                                     BRODY
                         Your father would know. Your father 
                         did know. Look. He made a map.

               Brody picks up the Grail Diary.

                                     BRODY
                         He must have pieced it together from 
                         clues scattered through the whole 
                         history of the Grail Quest. A map 
                         with no names.

               INSERT: A PENCIL-DRAWN MAP

               It covers two pages of the Diary. Brody's finger moves across 
               it.

                                     BRODY
                         Now, he knew there was a city with 
                         an oasis due east. Here. He knew the 
                         course turned south through the desert 
                         to a river, and the river led into 
                         the mountains. Here. Straight to the 
                         canyon. He knew everything except 
                         where to begin, the name of the city.

                                     INDY
                              (solemnly)
                         Alexandretta. Now we know.

                                     BRODY
                         Yes. Now we know.

                                     INDY
                              (rising)
                         Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him 
                         to meet you in Iskenderun.

               Indy closes the Grail Diary and puts it into the pocket of 
               his robe.

                                     BRODY
                         What about you?

                                     INDY
                         I'm going after Dad.

               INT. INDY'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Indy opens the door. His bedroom has been ransacked... the 
               mattress on the floor, the drawers turned out.

               INT. HALLWAY - DAY

               Indy approaches another door (Elsa's bedroom) and knocks.

                                     INDY
                         Elsa?

               He goes in.

               INT. ELSA'S BEDROOM - DAY

               ...and finds that Elsa's bedroom is in a similar ransacked 
               state to his own. The room is empty.

               He is worried for her, knocks and calls out:

                                     INDY
                         Elsa?

               He steps into the room and knocks upon the bathroom door.

                                     INDY
                         Elsa?

               He opens the bathroom door, peering inside.

                                     INDY
                         Elsa?

               INT. ELSA'S BATHROOM - DAY

               Elsa is standing before a mirror, wearing a silk bathrobe. 
               She gasps, startled, as Indy enters. He retreats back into 
               her bedroom as she reaches up to turn off a record player 
               sitting on a ledge above the bathtub.

               INT. ELSA'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Elsa joins Indy, waiting in the ransacked room. She looks 
               around in shock.

                                     ELSA
                         My room!

                                     INDY
                         Mine, too.

                                     ELSA
                         What were they looking for?

               She looks to Indy, who pulls the Grail Diary from his pocket.

                                     INDY
                         This.

                                     ELSA
                         The Grail Diary.

                                     INDY
                         Uh-huh.

                                     ELSA
                         You had it? You didn't trust me!

               She looks hurt and beautiful. She comes closer to him.

                                     INDY
                         I didn't know you.

               She's awfully hard to resist.

                                     INDY
                         At least I let you tag along.

                                     ELSA
                         Oh, yes. Give them a flower and 
                         they'll follow you anywhere.

                                     INDY
                         Knock it off. You're not mad.

                                     ELSA
                         No?

                                     INDY
                         No. You like the way I do things.

                                     ELSA
                         It's lucky I don't do things the 
                         same way. You'd still be standing at 
                         the Venice pier.

               She stomps her foot angrily. Indy flinches. She starts to 
               walk away but Indy grabs her.

                                     INDY
                         Look, what do you think is going on 
                         here? Since I've met you, I've nearly 
                         been incinerated, drowned, shot at, 
                         and chopped into fish bait. We're 
                         caught in the middle of something 
                         sinister here. My guess is Dad found 
                         out more than he was looking for. 
                         And until I'm sure, I'm going to 
                         continue to do things the way I think 
                         they should be done.

               He pulls her to him and kisses her.

                                     ELSA
                         How dare you kiss me!

               Now Elsa reaches for Indy and kisses him.

                                     INDY
                         Leave me alone. I don't like fast 
                         women.

               But he embraces her, and Elsa begins to nibble at his ear.

                                     ELSA
                         And I hate arrogant men.

               Indy smiles slyly as they fall to the bed.

               EXT. VENICE CANAL - DAY

               A GONDOLIER SINGS as he steers his gondola carrying two 
               passengers past Indy's window.

               INT. INDY'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Indy lies on top of Elsa, kissing her. He stops for a moment 
               as he hears the Gondolier SINGING.

                                     INDY
                         Ahh, Venice.

               Elsa reaches up and pulls him back down to her.

               EXT. ROAD THROUGH THE AUSTRIAN MOUNTAINS - DAY

               A Mercedes-Benz glides through the sharp mountain curves. 
               This is SUPERIMPOSED OVER A MAP that charts their course 
               from Venice across Austria toward Salzburg.

               EXT. CASTLE IN THE AUSTRIAN MOUNTAINS - DAY

               Storm clouds darken the skies. THUNDER EXPLODES in the 
               distance; lightning flashes. The Mercedes-Benz drives into 
               the courtyard of the formidable stone castle.

                                     INDY
                         What do you know about this place?

                                     ELSA
                         I know the Brunwalds are famous art 
                         collectors.

               INT. MERCEDES-BENZ - DAY

               Indy reaches into the back seat and retrieves his bullwhip.

                                     ELSA
                         What are you going to do?

                                     INDY
                         Don't know. Think of something.

               He glances up to the beret Elsa is wearing. She reaches up 
               and adjusts it.

               INT. CASTLE ENTRANCE HALL - DAY

               A BUTLER walks to the door and opens it to reveal Indy and 
               Elsa standing outside in the rain. She now wears Indy's 
               fedora; Indy is wearing Elsa's beret.

                                     BUTLER
                         Yes?

               Indy, followed by Elsa, steps inside, shaking the water from 
               his overcoat. He adopts a Scottish accent.

                                     INDY
                         And not before time! Did you intend 
                         to leave us standing on the doorstep 
                         all day? We're drenched!

               As Indy says this he pushes his way past the startled Butler, 
               pulling a handkerchief from the man's pocket. Elsa follows, 
               taking off her coat. Indy SNEEZES HARD.

                                     INDY
                         Now look! I've gone and caught a 
                         sniffle.

               Indy dabs at his nose with the handkerchief as Elsa looks on 
               in amused amazement.

                                     BUTLER
                              (coldly; with Austrian 
                              accent)
                         Are you expected?

                                     INDY
                         Don't take that tone with me, my 
                         good man. Now buttle off and tell 
                         Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence 
                         MacDonald and his lovely assistant 
                         are here to view the tapestries.

                                     BUTLER
                         Tapestries?

                                     INDY
                         Dear me, the man is dense. This is a 
                         castle, isn't it? There are 
                         tapestries?

                                     BUTLER
                         This is a castle. And we have many 
                         tapestries. But if you're a Scottish 
                         lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.

                                     INDY
                         How dare he?!

               Simultaneously knocking the Butler cold with one slug on the 
               jaw. The Butler falls against a wall tapestry, sliding down 
               to the floor, out cold.

               INT. CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY

               Indy and Elsa move cautiously and quietly down the wide, 
               vaulted hallway. APPROACHING VOICES ARE HEARD. Indy and Elsa 
               creep past a room full of NAZI SOLDIERS working around a 
               large table with a map atop it..

               Indy reacts to the sight of them.

                                     INDY
                              (to Elsa; softly)
                         Nazis. I hate these guys.

               Indy and Elsa continue down the hallway. Indy carries a gun 
               in his hand and his whip hangs from his belt. He steps to a 
               closed door and listens.

                                     INDY
                         This one. I think he's in here.

                                     ELSA
                         How do you know?

               Indy points out an ELECTRICAL WIRE.

                                     INDY
                         Because it's wired.

               He studies the situation for a moment, then decides to enter 
               one of the other doors. He knocks at the door -- there is no 
               response. He looks back at Elsa and enters.

               INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

               The room is dark and empty. Indy throws open the window 
               shutters and looks out. RAIN comes down in sheets. There is 
               a wide ledge beneath each window -- but below that is a SHEER 
               DROP. Indy wants to get out onto the window ledge, which is 
               several yards away.

                                     ELSA
                         Indy? Indy?

               Indy reassures her.

                                     INDY
                         Don't worry... this is kid's play. 
                         I'll be right back.

               He leans out the window and wraps his bullwhip around some 
               wires that protrude from the castle wall above the next 
               window.

               He gives the whip a forceful tug to make certain it will 
               hold his weight.

               EXT. THE CASTLE - DAY

               Indy SWINGS from the window to the stone gargoyle.

               CLOSE ON THE WINDOW LEDGE

               A PAIR OF WOODEN SHUTTERS seals the window.

               Indy takes hold of the bullwhip with both hands, pushes off 
               with his feet... swings toward the shuttered window with his 
               feet extended... CRASHING THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS as a 
               CLAP OF THUNDER disguises the noise.

               INT. THE ROOM - DAY

               Indy CRASHES THROUGH SHUTTERS AND GLASS into the room. The 
               broken shutters hang by their hinges. Rain and cold air whip 
               through the open window.

               No sooner does Indy get to his feet, than a VASE COMES 
               CRASHING DOWN ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD.

               Stunned, Indy sinks to one knee... and Indy's father, 
               PROFESSOR Henry JONES, steps out of the shadows.

                                     HENRY
                         Junior?

               Indy gets to his feet.

                                     INDY
                              (a reflex)
                         Yes, sir!

               This reply is a kneejerk reaction on Indy's part. Now they 
               look at each other.

                                     HENRY
                         It is you Junior!

                                     INDY
                              (an old familiar 
                              irritation)
                         Don't call me that, please.

                                     HENRY
                              (amazed)
                         But what are you doing here?

                                     INDY
                         I came to get you! What do you think?

               NAZI VOICES ARE HEARD approaching. Indy and Henry press 
               themselves against the wall, Henry still holding the broken 
               vase in his hand.

               Indy steps to the window and looks down. Henry moves to a 
               lamp, holding the vase under the light for a closer look.

                                     HENRY
                              (sotto, mumbled)
                         Late Fourteenth Century, Ming Dynasty.

               Henry is all about the broken vase which he still holds in 
               his hand. Father and son get onto crossed lines for a couple 
               of moments.

                                     HENRY
                         Oh, it breaks the heart.

                                     INDY
                              (quietly to himself)
                         And the head.
                              (to Henry, aggrievedly)
                         You hit me, Dad!

                                     HENRY
                              (referring to the 
                              vase)
                         I'll never forgive myself --

                                     INDY
                              (surprised, 
                              misunderstanding)
                         Don't worry -- I'm fine.

                                     HENRY
                         Thank God!

               Henry has clearly been concentrating entirely on the vase... 
               he is examining the broken end carefully.

                                     HENRY
                         ...it's fake. See, you can tell by 
                         the cross section.

               Henry throws the vase against the wall where it SHATTERS.

                                     INDY
                         No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got 
                         to get out of here.

                                     HENRY
                         Well, I am sorry about your head, 
                         though. But I thought you were one 
                         of them.

                                     INDY
                         Dad, they come in through the doors.

                                     HENRY
                              (laughs)
                         Good point.

               Indy steps to the door and stands, listening.

                                     HENRY
                         But better safe than sorry.

               Henry slides his umbrella through the straps of his bag.

                                     HENRY
                         Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. 
                         But by God, I wasn't wrong when I 
                         mailed you my Diary. You obviously 
                         got it.

                                     INDY
                         I got it and I used it. We found the 
                         entrance to the catacombs.

                                     HENRY
                              (excited)
                         Through the library?

                                     INDY
                         Right.

                                     HENRY
                         I knew it. And the tomb of Sir 
                         Richard?

               Indy nods.

                                     INDY
                         Found it.

                                     HENRY
                              (breathless)
                         He was actually there? You saw him?

                                     INDY
                         Well, what was left of him.

                                     HENRY
                              (trembling with 
                              anticipation)
                         And his shield... the inscription on 
                         Sir Richard's shield...?

                                     INDY
                         Alexandretta.
                              (beat)
                         It's a great moment in Henry's life. 
                         He turns aside, lost to himself for 
                         a moment, then turns to Indy with 
                         joy.

                                     HENRY
                         Alexandretta... of course... on the 
                         pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. 
                         Oh, Junior...

               Indy winces, and would interrupt but suddenly it's not the 
               moment.

                                     HENRY
                         ...you did it.

                                     INDY
                         No, Dad. You did. Forty years.

                                     HENRY
                         If only I could have been with you.

                                     INDY
                         There were rats, Dad.

                                     HENRY
                         Rats?

                                     INDY
                         Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis 
                         want with you Dad?

                                     HENRY
                         They want my diary.

                                     INDY
                              (interested)
                         Yeah?

               Indy's interest is a moment which becomes important later 
               but for now it passes.

                                     HENRY
                         I knew I had to get that book as far 
                         away from me as I possibly could.

               Indy's hand moves unconsciously to his pocket. His eyes turn 
               inward.

                                     INDY
                              (thoughtfully)
                         Yeah...

               Then... BAM! The door is kicked open and three NAZIS enter. 
               One is an S.S. OFFICER. The other two are SOLDIERS with 
               machine guns. Henry and Indy raise their hands.

                                     S.S. OFFICER
                         Doctor Jones!!

                                     HENRY & INDY
                         Yes!!

                                     S.S. OFFICER
                         I will take the book now.

                                     INDY & HENRY
                              (simultaneously)
                         What book?

                                     S.S. OFFICER
                              (to Indy)
                         You have the Diary in your pocket.

               Henry laughs genuinely, believing himself to be laughing at 
               the expense of the S.S. Officer.

                                     HENRY
                         Do you think that my son would be 
                         that stupid that he would bring my 
                         Diary all the way back here?

               At which point an awful thought strikes Henry.

                                     HENRY
                         You didn't, did you?
                              (a beat)
                         You didn't bring it, did you?

                                     INDY
                         Well, uh...

                                     HENRY
                         You did!!

                                     INDY
                         Look, can we discuss this later?

                                     HENRY
                         I should have mailed it to the Marx 
                         Brothers.

                                     INDY
                              (overlapping)
                         Will you take it easy!

                                     HENRY
                         Take it easy?! Why do you think I 
                         sent it home in the first place?
                              (points towards the 
                              Nazis)
                         So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!

                                     INDY
                         I came here to save you.

                                     HENRY
                         Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to 
                         save you, Junior??

               Indy's eyes blazes. His nostrils flares. He's so pissed off, 
               he literally RIPS A MACHINE GUN from the hands of one of the 
               startled soldiers... and for a moment we think he's going to 
               use it on his dad.

                                     INDY
                         I told you --

               He turns and sprays the room with machine gun fire, cutting 
               all three Nazis to ribbons and blowing them backwards across 
               the room.

                                     INDY
                         Don't call me Junior!

               Henry looks shocked and horrified.

                                     HENRY
                         Look what you did!!

               Indy grabs him and pushes him ahead.

                                     HENRY
                              (aghast)
                         I can't believe what you just...

               INT. CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY

               Indy leads Henry down the hallway as he searches for Elsa.

                                     INDY
                         Elsa? Elsa?

               He opens a door and enters:

               INT. FIRST CASTLE ROOM - DAY

               Indy and Henry rush back into the room where Elsa had been 
               left, only to find: A NAZI COLONEL HOLDING ELSA HOSTAGE.

               His name is Vogel: a vicious-looking, lantern jawed brute. 
               One arm is wrapped around Elsa's waist, the other hand presses 
               the muzzle of a LUGER behind her ear.

                                     VOGEL
                         That's far enough Put down the gun, 
                         Doctor Jones. Put down the gun or 
                         the Fraulein dies.

                                     HENRY
                         But she's one of them!

                                     ELSA
                         Indy, please!

                                     HENRY
                         She's a Nazi!

                                     INDY
                         What?!

               Indy is thrown. He doesn't know what to do. He looks at Elsa, 
               then back to his father. Everyone is yelling at once:

                                     HENRY
                         Trust me!

                                     ELSA
                         Indy, no!

                                     VOGEL
                         I will kill her!

                                     HENRY
                         Oh yeah? Go ahead!

                                     INDY
                         No! Don't Shoot!

                                     HENRY
                              (to Indy)
                         Don't worry. He won't.

                                     ELSA
                         Indy, please! Do what he says!

                                     HENRY
                         And don't listen to her!

                                     VOGEL
                         Enough! She dies!

               Vogel jams the barrel of the Luger painfully into Elsa's 
               neck. Elsa SCREAMS.

                                     INDY
                         Wait! Wait!

               And then Indy gives in. He drops the machine gun to the table 
               and it slides across, SHATTERING GLASS. Henry GROANS audibly.

               Vogel releases his grip on Elsa and shoves her toward Indy. 
               She is propelled directly into his arms. He holds her tightly. 
               She buries her face in his chest.

                                     ELSA
                         I'm sorry.

               Indy comforts her.

                                     INDY
                         No, don't be.

               Her hand slips into his coat pocket and removes the Grail 
               Diary.

                                     ELSA
                         But you should have listened to your 
                         father.

               She steps back next to Vogel. Indy is stunned. Henry gives 
               him his most withering look of reprimand.

               INT. BARONIAL ROOM - DAY

               A large baronial room decorated with ancient tapestries and 
               suits of armor. Firelight -- from the giant fireplace -- 
               dances across the ceiling and walls.

               Indy and Henry are ushered in, hands tied behind back, 
               accompanied by Vogel and Elsa and TWO NAZI GUARDS.

               Elsa crosses the room toward a high-backed chair facing the 
               fireplace. Indy and Henry do not have the advantage of seeing 
               who is sitting in that chair. They only see a HAND REACH OUT 
               AND TAKE THE BOOK.

                                     INDY
                              (quietly to Henry)
                         She ransacked her own room and I 
                         fell for it. How did you know she 
                         was a Nazi?

                                     HENRY
                         Umh?

                                     INDY
                         How did you she was a Nazi?

                                     HENRY
                         She talks in her sleep.

               Indy nods, and then the statement catches up with him. He 
               looks at Henry with surprise.

                                     HENRY
                         I didn't trust her. Why did you?

                                     MAN IN CHAIR
                         Because he didn't take my advice.

               The MAN IN THE CHAIR gets to his feet and turns, revealing 
               himself to be... Walter Donovan. Indy and Henry react with 
               stunned expressions.

                                     INDY
                         DONOVAN!

                                     DONOVAN
                         Didn't I warn you not to trust 
                         anybody, Doctor Jones?

               Donovan smiles benignly and flips through the Grail Diary.

                                     HENRY
                         I misjudged you Walter -- I knew 
                         you'd sell your mother for an Etruscan 
                         vase. But I didn't know you'd sell 
                         your country and your soul to the 
                         slime of humanity.

                                     DONOVAN
                              (suddenly erupting)
                         Doctor Schneider. There're pages 
                         torn out of this!

               Elsa rushes to Donovan's side. She takes the Grail Diary 
               from him. Elsa takes a look for herself -- then glances up 
               at Indy.

                                     ELSA
                         This book contained a map -- a map 
                         with no names -- precise directions 
                         from the unknown city to the secret 
                         Canyon of the Crescent Moon.

                                     INDY
                         So it did.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Where are these missing pages? This 
                         maps we must have these pages backs

               Henry gives Indy a look of surprise. Indy smirks.

                                     ELSA
                              (to Donovan)
                         You're wasting your breath. He won't 
                         tell us. And he doesn't have to... 
                         it's perfectly obvious where the 
                         pages are...
                              (looking at Indy)
                         ...he's given them to Marcus Brody.

               Henry now wears a pained expression.

                                     HENRY
                              (to Indy)
                         Marcus?! You didn't drag poor Marcus 
                         along, did you? He's not up to the 
                         challenge.

                                     DONOVAN
                         He sticks out like a sore thumb. 
                         We'll find him.

                                     INDY
                         The hell you will. He's got a two-
                         day head-start on you, which is more 
                         than he needs.
                              (beat)
                         Brody's got friends in every town 
                         and village from here to the Sudan. 
                         He speaks a dozen languages, knows 
                         every local custom. He'll blend in. 
                         Disappear. You'll never see him again. 
                         With any luck, he's got the Grail 
                         already.

               Henry looks amazed and impressed.

               EXT. TRAIN STATION - CITY OF ISKENDERUN - DAY

               Brody disembarks from the train along with the other 
               PASSENGERS, a cross-section of ARABS and TUSKS.

                                     BRODY
                         Does anyone here speak English? Or 
                         even ancient Greek?

               A Man in the crowd holds out a cup of water to Brody.

                                     BRODY
                         No water, no thank you. No, fish 
                         make love in it.

               Brody continues through the crowd past various STREET VENDORS. 
               A Woman holds a chicken out to him.

                                     BRODY
                         Thank you so much. No, I don't like 
                         that. No, I really don't want... No, 
                         no, thank you very much. No, thank 
                         you, madam. I'm a vegetarian.

               The Woman walks away, leaving Brody alone in the crowd.

                                     BRODY
                         Does anyone understand a word I'm 
                         saying here?

               Sallah shoulders his way through the mob toward Brody.

                                     SALLAH
                         Mister Brody!

               They meet and hug, then begin to walk.

                                     BRODY
                         Oh, Sallah! What a relief!

                                     SALLAH
                              (laughs)
                         Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?

                                     BRODY
                              (overlapping)
                         Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.

                                     SALLAH
                         You are on your own?

               A Woman runs in and tugs on Brody's coat. He waves her away.

                                     BRODY
                         Yes, but don't panic. Everything's 
                         under control. Have you... have you 
                         arranged our supplies?

                                     SALLAH
                         Oh, yes, of course. But where are we 
                         going?

                                     BRODY
                         Oh, this map will show you. It was 
                         drawn by, uh...

               Brody searches in his coat pocket for the map as a SINISTER 
               MAN approaches.

                                     SINISTER MAN
                         Mister Brody?

               Brody puts the map back in his pocket. The Sinister Man clicks 
               his heels and bows quickly.

                                     SINISTER MAN
                         Welcome to Iskenderun. The Director 
                         of the Museum of Antiquities has 
                         sent a car for you.

               Brody takes off his hat.

                                     BRODY
                         Oh, what?... your servant, sir.

                                     SALLAH
                         And I am his.

                                     SINISTER MAN
                         Follow me, please.

               The man turns and joins a SECOND MAN. Brody and Sallah follow 
               them.

                                     BRODY
                         My reputation precedes me.

                                     SALLAH
                         There is no museum in Iskenderun.

               The Second Man overhears Sallah. He and his companion turn 
               quickly.

                                     SECOND MAN
                         Papers please.

                                     SALLAH
                         Papers?
                              (laughs)
                         Of course.

               Sallah puts Brody's luggage down and glances at Brody.

                                     SALLAH
                         Run.

               Brody does not run. Sallah pats his clothing, searching for 
               his papers.

                                     BRODY
                         Yes.

                                     SALLAH
                         Papers, sir. Got it here.

               Sallah laughs and pulls out a newspaper.

                                     SALLAH
                         Just finished reading it myself.
                              (laughs; then, to 
                              Brody)
                         Run!

               Brody looks confused. Sallah shows the newspaper to the Second 
               Man.

                                     BRODY
                         Yes.

                                     SALLAH
                         Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.
                              (to Brody)
                         Run!

                                     BRODY
                         Did you say...? Uh, uh...

               Sallah puts the newspaper in front of the Second Man's face, 
               then punches him through the newspaper.

                                     SALLAH
                         Run!

               The Second Man falls, knocking over a vendor's stand. Sallah 
               and Brody begin to run. Sallah knocks the First Man into 
               another vendor's stand. The STAND COLLAPSES on impact.

               Sallah grabs Brody and pulls him through the crowded streets.

                                     SALLAH
                              (to Brody; pointing)
                         Okay, okay, quick, quick, quick! 
                         Hide in that door! Hide in that door!

               Sallah points to a DARKENED DOORWAY, hung with a curtain, at 
               the top of a ramp. Brody runs up the ramp, throws back the 
               curtain and disappears into the darkness.

               Then -- METAL DOORS ARE SLAMMED behind Brody and we realize 
               that he has actually run into the back of a Nazi TROOP TRUCK.

               Sallah runs after the Truck until he reaches a wall, then 
               leans against the wall dejectedly as the Truck drives away 
               with Brody inside.

               INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

               The room is dark. Ancient, floor-length drapes cover the 
               windows. A HUGE FIREPLACE that's nearly large enough for a 
               man to stand upright in dominates one wall.

               The Nazi Guards have tied Indy and Henry back-to-back in a 
               pair of chairs. Elsa and Donovan stand over them. Vogel 
               enters.

                                     HENRY
                         Intolerable.

                                     VOGEL
                         Doctor Schneider. Message from Berlin. 
                         You must return immediately: a rally 
                         at the Institute of Aryan Culture.

                                     ELSA
                         So?

                                     VOGEL
                         Your presence on the platform is 
                         requested... at the highest level.

                                     ELSA
                         Thank you, Herr Oberst.
                              (to Donovan)
                         I will meet you at Iskenderun.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Take this Diary to the Reich Museum 
                         in Berlin. It will show them our 
                         progress, ahead of schedule. Without 
                         a map, I'm afraid it's no better 
                         than a souvenir.

               He hands her the Grail Diary.

                                     VOGEL
                              (to Donovan, meaning 
                              Indy and Henry)
                         Let me kill them now.

                                     ELSA
                         No. If we fail to recover the pages 
                         from Brody, we'll need them alive.

                                     DONOVAN
                              (to Vogel, with a 
                              helpless shrug)
                         Always do what the doctor orders.

               Donovan leads Vogel out. The Nazi Guards follow. Once they 
               are gone, Elsa turns to Indy.

                                     ELSA
                         Don't look at me like that -- we 
                         both wanted the Grail, I would have 
                         done anything to get it. You would 
                         have done the same.

               Indy shakes his head "no."

                                     INDY
                         I'm sorry you think so.

               She runs her hand down the side of his face. Indy pulls away.

               Indy and Henry are still tied back-to-back of course. Elsa 
               bends to speak quietly into Indy's ear... which is near enough 
               to Henry's ear.

                                     ELSA
                              (whispers)
                         I can't forget... how wonderful it 
                         was.

                                     HENRY
                         Thank you. It was rather wonderful.

               She smiles and kisses Indy passionately. Henry glances back 
               and looks rather disappointed.

               Vogel appears to remind Elsa of her appointment.

                                     VOGEL
                         Doctor Schneider! Your car is waiting.

                                     ELSA
                              (to Indy, after 
                              finishing the kiss)
                         That's how Austrians say goodbye.

               Elsa exits. Vogel stays behind for another moment.

                                     VOGEL
                         And this is how we say goodbye in 
                         Germany, Doctor Jones.

               Vogel punches Indy in the jaw. A hard and vicious jab that 
               snaps Indy's head around.

                                     HENRY
                         Ohh...

               Vogel exits. Indy shakes his head clear.

                                     INDY
                              (to himself)
                         Ooooh... I like the Austrian way 
                         better.

                                     HENRY
                         So did I.

                                     INDY
                         Let's try and get these ropes loose. 
                         We've got to get to Marcus before 
                         the Nazis do!

                                     HENRY
                              (confused)
                         You said he had two days' start. 
                         That he would blend in. Disappear!

                                     INDY
                         Are you kidding? -- I made that up! 
                         You know Marcus -- he got lost once 
                         in his own museum!

               Indy and Henry are pulling at the ropes with great urgency.

                                     INDY
                         Can you try and reach into my left 
                         jacket pocket?

               Henry is able to wiggle his hand towards Indy's coat pocket. 
               Indy squirms his body around towards Henry's hand.

                                     HENRY
                         What am I looking for?

                                     INDY
                         My lucky charm.

                                     HENRY
                         Feels like a cigarette lighter.

                                     INDY
                         Try and burn through the ropes.

               Henry's fingers open the lighter and ignite the flame.

                                     HENRY
                         Very good.

               Henry yelps as the cigarette lighter burns his hand. He drops 
               the lighter to the floor. Henry kicks at the lighter, trying 
               to reach it, but cannot. The rug starts to burn. Indy doesn't 
               know it yet.

                                     HENRY
                         I ought to tell you something.

                                     INDY
                         Don't get sentimental now Dad -- 
                         save it 'til we get out of here.

                                     HENRY
                         The floor's on fire! See?!

                                     INDY
                              (turns and sees)
                         What???

                                     HENRY
                         And the chair.

                                     INDY
                         All right, move! Move! Rock your 
                         Chair. Do what I do.

               They begin to rock their chair legs, inching their way off 
               the burning carpet.

               EXT. CASTLE - DAY

               As Elsa is driven away. Vogel and Donovan remain behind, 
               flanked by NAZI SOLDIERS.

               Another car pulls up and Vogel holds the door open for Donovan 
               who gets into the rear seat. A LIEUTENANT approaches with a 
               written message for Donovan.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         Etwas Wichtiges, mein Herr.

               Donovan puts on his glasses to read the message.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Well, we have Marcus Brody. But more 
                         important, we have the map.

               A RADIO OPERATOR steps forward with yet another written 
               message for Donovan.

                                     RADIO OPERATOR
                         Aus Berlin, mein Herr.

                                     DONOVAN
                              (reading)
                         "By the personal command of the 
                         Fuhrer. Secrecy essential to success. 
                         Eliminate the American conspirators."
                              (to Vogel)
                         Germany has declared war on the Jones 
                         boys.
                              (to DRIVER)
                         Losfahren.

               The car drives off.

               INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

               Indy and Henry are still in their chairs, tied back-to-back. 
               Indy tries to communicate with Henry, but each time he calls 
               him, the men turn their heads in opposite directions.

                                     INDY
                         Dad!

                                     HENRY
                         What?

                                     INDY
                         Dad!

                                     HENRY
                         What?

                                     INDY
                         Dad!

               Finally they turn their heads in the same direction.

                                     HENRY
                         What?

                                     INDY
                         Head for the fireplace!

                                     HENRY
                         Oh.

               BANGING, ROCKING and HOPPING their chairs, they work their 
               way INTO THE FIREPLACE -- the only safe place from the now 
               ROARING FIRE.

                                     INDY
                         I think I can get these ropes off.

               Indy struggles to free his hands. His foot kicks out and 
               accidentally hits a metal grill that operates a Secret Door.

                                     INDY
                         Whoops!

               The fireplace floor rotates like a Lazy Susan and Indy and 
               his father find themselves in the:

               INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

               Where a NAZI RADIOMAN wearing headphones sits at an elaborate 
               panel of dials, switches and meters, and a WOMAN stands over 
               a map plotting coordinates. Their backs are turned to Indy 
               and Henry.

               The floor begins to rotate again, and Indy and Henry find 
               themselves back in:

               INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

               inside the fireplace, still tied back-to-back.

                                     HENRY
                         Our situation has not improved.

               Indy glances over his shoulder at Henry.

                                     INDY
                         Listen Dad... I'm almost free.

               Indy's foot hits the grill again... and the fireplace rotates 
               to:

               INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

               FOUR NAZI RADIOMEN and the Woman are still hard at work with 
               controls and coordinates. Suddenly the Woman looks up and 
               spots Henry and Indy. She screams.

                                     WOMAN
                         Alarm!

               Now the Radioman turn to see Henry and Indy.

                                     WOMAN
                         Schnell!!

               TWO NAZIS draw their revolvers and FIRE SEVERAL SHOTS at 
               Indy and Henry

               INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAWN

               Indy and Henry rotate into the room which is now an INFERNO. 
               The carpet, drapes and furniture are all ablaze.

                                     HENRY
                         This is intolerable!

                                     INDY
                         I'm out, Dad!

               Indy finally breaks free. And he immediately begins to untie 
               his father.

                                     HENRY
                         Well done, boy!

               INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

               All four Radiomen now have their guns drawn. They activate 
               the lever and begin to rotate through the Secret Door.

               INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

               The Radiomen appear in the fireplace on the other side -- 
               but there is NO SIGN OF Indy and Henry.

               The Radiomen move cautiously toward the flame, shielding 
               their faces with one hand, holding their guns with the other. 
               Is it possible that Indy and Henry escaped through these 
               flames?

               Not a chance.

               They've hidden themselves UP THE CHIMNEY. And now they DROP 
               DOWN, BEHIND the Radiomen.

               One of the Radiomen grabs Indy by the neck. As they struggle 
               they fall against the rotating wall and disappear into the 
               next room, leaving a frightened Henry behind.

               Henry presses against the wall, which rotates again. As he 
               disappears into the next room, a DEAD NAZI RADIOMAN swivels 
               into the room. The other Nazis rush forward to him.

               INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

               Indy picks up a BUST OF HITLER and uses it to jam the rotating 
               wall in place, sealing the Nazis inside the burning room.

               INT. CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY

               Vogel strides purposefully down the hallway. He BARKS an 
               order, and TWO MORE NAZIS fall into step with him.

               INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

               Indy grabs his whip, his leather sack and Henry's case from 
               a table. He hands the case to Henry and they begin to run.

                                     INDY
                         Come on Dad.

               INT. SECRET ROOM - DAY

               Indy and Henry step into an empty room.

                                     INDY
                         Dead end.

               Henry looks horrified by what he's been forced to do as Indy 
               searches frantically for an exit.

                                     INDY
                         There's got to be a... a secret door 
                         around. A passageway or something.

               Indy begins to run his hands over the walls -- frantic.

                                     HENRY
                         I find that if I just sit down and 
                         think...

               Henry sits on a chair which tips back, hitting the wall behind 
               it. The floor at Indy's feet suddenly begins DROPPING AWAY!

               Indy grabs a railing to keep from falling, but loses his 
               grip and plunges through the opening which has formed a SPIRAL 
               STAIRCASE. He rolls down the stairs.

                                     INDY
                         Dad!

                                     HENRY
                         ...the solution presents itself.

               Henry follows Indy down the staircase.

               INT. CAVERN / UNDERGROUND HARBOR - DAY

               The stairway deposits Indy and Henry into an enormous WATERY 
               CAVERN beneath the mountain on which the castle was built.

               A full-scale Nazi BOAT DOCK has been built inside the cavern. 
               We see MOTORBOATS, GUNBOATS, SUPPLY BOATS, etc.

                                     INDY
                         Great. More boats.

               Indy boards one of the motorboats and STARTS THE MOTOR.

                                     HENRY
                         Would you say this has been just 
                         another typical day for you? Huh?

               Henry tosses his case at Indy who catches it and angrily 
               throws it back to his father.

                                     INDY
                              (ironically)
                         Ooof! No! It's been better than most.

               Indy moves back to the dock and pushes the boat away. Henry 
               looks confused.

                                     INDY
                         Come on, Dad. Come on!

                                     HENRY
                         What about the boat? We're not going 
                         on the boat?

               INT. SECRET ROOM - DAY

               Vogel and the Nazi Soldiers enter the room and spot the spiral 
               staircase leading below. They quickly descend the stairs.

               INT. CAVERN / UNDERGROUND HARBOR - DAY

               As Vogel and the Nazi Soldiers rush to the dock. Vogel sees 
               that a motorboat is missing. He orders the Nazi Soldiers 
               into a boat.

                                     VOGEL
                         Sie alle ins Boat. Schnell!

               CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL

               A large box which suddenly BREAKS APART as Indy, now on a 
               motorbike with Henry in the sidecar, ROARS PAST THE DOCK, 
               hitting TWO NAZI SOLDIERS who scream as they fall into the 
               river.

               Vogel screams after Indy and Henry as they drive off.

                                                           STRAIGHT CUT TO:

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

               Indy looks pleased as he drives the motorbike along the road, 
               but Henry appears worried.

                                     INDY
                         Ha!

               FOUR NAZI SOLDIERS ON MOTORCYCLES

               They chase down the road after Indy and Henry.

               Indy turns the motorbike down a smaller, dusty tree-lined 
               road. Henry gasps as he is jostled about in the sidecar. One 
               of the Nazi Soldiers gives chase along a higher road running 
               in the same direction.

               EXT. ROAD BARRICADE - DAY

               Indy approaches the barricade from one direction as one of 
               the Nazi Soldiers approaches from a higher road.

               A GUARD steps from the road station and calls to the vehicles 
               as Indy and Henry SMASH THROUGH THE BARRICADE.

                                     GUARD
                         Halt! Halt!

               The Nazi Soldier rides his motorcycle through the other side 
               of the barrier -- IT SHATTERS.

               INDY AND HENRY

               Indy grabs at a FLAGPOLE as they roar past -- it snaps off 
               in his hand.

               The Nazi Soldier drives his motorcycle toward Indy and Henry. 
               He unshoulders his machine gun.

               Indy uses the broken flagpole as a lance and knocks the Nazi 
               Soldier from his motorcycle.

               THE RIDERLESS MOTORCYCLE

               Drives on toward the other Nazi Soldiers now approaching the 
               guardhouse, COLLIDING WITH TWO OF THEM.

               The remaining Nazi Soldier maneuvers his motorcycle around 
               his fallen comrades and continues the chase.

               INDY AND HENRY

               As the remaining Nazi Soldier rides alongside their motorbike 
               he cocks his gun, preparing to fire.

               Indy quickly jams the remaining portion of the flagpole 
               through the spokes of the Nazi's front wheel.

               The NAZI SOLDIER'S MOTORCYCLE FLIPS THREE TIMES, throwing 
               him high into the air.

               Indy glances back and smiles, but the smile fades as he looks 
               forward again to see a sign at a CROSSROAD. Arrows pointing 
               in opposite directions indicate the way to "BERLIN" or 
               "VENEDIG".

               Indy starts down the road marked "VENEDIG".

                                     HENRY
                         Stop!

                                     INDY
                         What?

                                     HENRY
                         Stop! Stop!

               The motorbike skids to a stop.

                                     HENRY
                         You're going the wrong Way! We have 
                         to get to Berlin!

                                     INDY
                              (pointing towards 
                              Venedig)
                         Brody's this way.

                                     HENRY
                         My Diary's in Berlin.

                                     INDY
                         You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus 
                         has the map.

                                     HENRY
                         There is more in the Diary than just 
                         the map.

                                     INDY
                         All right Dad -- tell me.

                                     HENRY
                         Well, he who finds the Grail must 
                         face the final challenge.

                                     INDY
                         What final challenge?

                                     HENRY
                         Three devices of such lethal cunning.

                                     INDY
                         Booby traps?

                                     HENRY
                         Oh, yes. But I found the clues that 
                         will safely take us through, in the 
                         Chronicles of St. Anselm.

                                     INDY
                         But what are they? Can't you remember?

                                     HENRY
                         I wrote them down in my Diary so 
                         that I wouldn't have to remember.

                                     INDY
                         Half the German Army's on our tail 
                         and you want me to go to Berlin? 
                         Into the lion's den?

                                     HENRY
                         Yes! The only thing that matters is 
                         the Grail.

                                     INDY
                         What about Marcus?

                                     HENRY
                         Marcus would agree with me.

                                     INDY
                         Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!

               Henry slaps him across the face. Indy is rocked to his 
               foundations, not by any means entirely by the blow itself.

                                     HENRY
                         That's for blasphemy. The quest for 
                         the Grail is not archaeology. It's a 
                         race against evil. If it is captured 
                         by the Nazis, the armies of darkness 
                         will march all over the face of the 
                         earth. Do you understand me?

                                     INDY
                         This is an obsession Dad. I never 
                         understood it. Never. Neither did 
                         Mom.

                                     HENRY
                         Oh yes, she did. Only too well. 
                         Unfortunately she kept her illness 
                         from me until all I could do was 
                         mourn her.

               EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

               Arrows point in opposite directions to VENICE and BERLIN. 
               The CAMERA MOVES IN on the portion of the sign reading BERLIN.

               EXT. CITY SQUARE - BERLIN - NIGHT

               A Nazi Rally -- a book-burning is in process.

               The mound of burning books is ten feet tall and growing by 
               the minute as College Students and Nazi Brownshirts 
               continually toss more books onto the fire.

               Flags, banners and standards displaying the swastika are 
               waved rhythmically from side to side in a motion that echoes 
               the mounting frenzy of the enormous crowd.

               Indy and Henry walk toward the Square. Indy wears the uniform 
               of a Nazi Soldier. He is now buttoning up the tunic -- which 
               happens to be several sizes too big.

                                     HENRY
                         My boy, we are Pilgrims in an unholy 
                         land.

               Then... Indy sees something that makes him stop in his tracks. 
               WE PAN ALONG HIS LINE OF SIGHT to:

               THE PODIUM

               Where high-ranking Officers of the Third Reich stand flanking 
               ADOLF HITLER as they oversee the rally.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Elsa is walking away in an open area, background of torches, 
               vehicles, Nazi Officers... one of whom is now none other 
               than Indy, coming up to her before she knows he is there. 
               His voice is quiet and tough, his eyes hard.

                                     INDY
                         Fraulein Doctor. Where is it?

               Still startled, her reaction makes it clear that Indy is 
               even now a lover in her thoughts.

                                     ELSA
                         How did you get here?

                                     INDY
                         Where is it? I want it.

               Indy pushes Elsa against a column and begins to search her 
               clothing for the Diary. He pulls the book from Elsa's pocket.

                                     ELSA
                         You came back for the book? Why?

                                     INDY
                         My father didn't want it incinerated.

               She understands him. It's as though he slapped her.

                                     ELSA
                         Is that what you think of me? I 
                         believe in the Grail, not the 
                         Swastika.

                                     INDY
                              (vicious)
                         Yet you stood up to be counted with 
                         the enemy of everything the Grail 
                         stands for -- who gives a damn what 
                         you think?

                                     ELSA
                              (hard and fast)
                         You do.

               Now it's as though she'd slapped him back. His hands fly to 
               her neck.

                                     INDY
                         All I have to do is squeeze.

                                     ELSA
                         All I have to do is scream.

               It's a standoff emotionally. He knows he'd never do it. she 
               knows it too. And the same goes for screaming.

               Indy releases her and backs away. She looks at him with a 
               lover's pain. He moves over to Henry.

                                     INDY
                         I've got it. Let's get the hell out 
                         of here.

               They move off and almost run headlong into Hitler and his 
               entire entourage coming down from the Podium. 50 kids push 
               their autograph books for Hitler's signature.

               Hitler pauses to sign them. Hitler looks Indy's way. They 
               make eye contact. It only lasts a moment but the moment is 
               electric.

               Hitler breaks the spell by taking the Grail Diary from him, 
               opens it to the first page and signs his autograph. He hands 
               it back and moves on.

               EXT. AIRFIELD - BERLIN, GERMANY - DAY

               Indy's motorcycle pulls up to the main terminal.

               INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - DAY

               A Plainclothes Agent distributes leaflets bearing HENRY'S 
               PICTURE to Nazi Soldiers inside the terminal.

               Henry leans in a doorway reading a newspaper as Indy enters 
               down the stairs and taps Henry's shoulder.

               They begin to walk toward the boarding gates.

                                     HENRY
                         What did you get?

                                     INDY
                         I don't know. The first available 
                         flight out of Germany.

                                     HENRY
                         Good.

               Indy and Henry show their papers to the Boarding Guards, 
               then join the line of passengers, which has already begun to 
               move toward a:

               MOORED ZEPPELIN

               Ten stories tall and longer than two football fields: Flying 
               in the grand tradition!

               INT. THE ZEPPELIN - PASSENGER COMPARTMENT - DAY

               The Zeppelin is about to take off. Indy and Henry make 
               themselves comfortable in one of the compartments.

                                     INDY
                         Well, we made it.

               Henry looks over his newspaper at Indy.

                                     HENRY
                         When we're airborne, with Germany 
                         behind us, then I'll share that 
                         sentiment.

                                     INDY
                         Relax.

               But Indy looks out the window and is suddenly concerned when 
               he sees:

               VOGEL AND A GESTAPO AGENT

               Rushing across the tarmac toward the Zeppelin.

                                     VOGEL
                         Nicht zumachen! Wir steigen ein!

               INDY

               Sits back in his chair, looks to Henry, now reading his 
               newspaper.

               A Steward enters and sets a bowl of nuts on the table in 
               front of Indy and Henry, then continues down the aisle of 
               passengers. Indy follows after the Steward. He puts his arm 
               around the Steward's shoulder and together they walk up a 
               flight of stairs.

               VOGEL

               Now walks up the aisle. He approaches a MALE PASSENGER hidden 
               behind a newspaper. Vogel uses his walking stick to lower 
               the newspaper and show the Passenger the leaflet with Henry's 
               photograph.

                                     VOGEL
                         Haben sie diesen Mann gesehen?

               The Passengers at the table shake their heads in the negative. 
               Vogel shows the picture to other Passengers.

                                     FEMALE PASSENGER
                         Nein.

                                     INDY (O.S.)
                         Fahrscheine, bitte.

                                     MALE PASSENGER
                         Nein.

               Vogel turns to see:

               INDY -- WEARING THE HAT AND JACKET OF THE CHIEF STEWARD

                                     MALE PASSENGER (O.S.)
                         Ich habe ihn nicht gesehen.

                                     INDY
                         Tickets please.

               The Passengers do not react to the request, made in English.

                                     INDY
                         Fahrscheine meine Dame. Bitte.

               VOGEL

               Approaches Henry, still hidden behind his newspaper. Again, 
               Vogel uses his walking stick to lower the paper, revealing 
               Henry's face.

                                     VOGEL
                         Guten Tag, Herr Jones.

               Now Indy, still playing the role of Steward, asks Vogel for 
               his ticket.

                                     INDY
                         Fahrscheine mein Herr.

                                     VOGEL
                         Weg.

                                     INDY
                         Tickets please.

               Henry looks confused.

                                     VOGEL
                              (in German)
                         Was?

               Vogel glances up and recognizes Indy -- who quickly punches 
               Vogel in the face, knocking him toward the window. In another 
               quick move, Indy TOSSES HIM OUT THE WINDOW onto the tarmac 
               below.

               Shocked Passengers blink in bewilderment.

                                     INDY
                              (in German; with a 
                              shrug)
                         No ticket.

               Everyone else with a ticket quickly produces it and waves it 
               in Indy's face.

               EXT. AIRFIELD TARMAC - DAY

               Vogel gets to his knees as the huge Zeppelin rises into the 
               sky above him, revealing an airplane attached to the belly 
               of the airship. Vogel shakes his fist at the rising Zeppelin.

                                     VOGEL
                         Du wirst nochmal horen von mir!

               INT. ZEPPELIN - DAY

               Indy and Henry together again in their compartment.

                                     HENRY
                         You know, sharing your adventures is 
                         an interesting experience.

                                     INDY
                              (meaning Elsa)
                         That's not all we shared. It's 
                         disgraceful. You're old enough to be 
                         her fa... er, her grandfather!

                                     HENRY
                         Well, I'm as human as the next man.

                                     INDY
                         I was the next man.

                                     HENRY
                              (laughs)
                         Ships that pass in the night...

               Henry opens his Diary and begins to thumb through it.

                                     INDY
                         Do you remember the last time we had 
                         a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.

                                     HENRY
                         Hmmm... What did we talk about?

                                     INDY
                         We didn't talk. We never talked.

                                     HENRY
                         And do I detect a rebuke?

                                     INDY
                         A regret. It was just the two of us, 
                         Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. 
                         For you, too. If you had been an 
                         ordinary, average father like the 
                         other guys' dads, you'd have 
                         understood that.

                                     HENRY
                         Actually, I was a wonderful father.

                                     INDY
                         When?

               Henry looks up from his Diary.

                                     HENRY
                         Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to 
                         bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? 
                         No. I respected your privacy and I 
                         taught you self-reliance.

                                     INDY
                         What you taught me was that I was 
                         less important to you than people 
                         who had been dead for five hundred 
                         years in another country. And I 
                         learned it so well that we've hardly 
                         spoken for twenty years.

                                     HENRY
                         You left just when you were becoming 
                         interesting.

                                     INDY
                         Dad, how can you?

                                     HENRY
                              (interrupting)
                         Very well. I'm here now.

               He closes the Diary and leans back in his seat.

                                     HENRY
                         What do you want to talk about? Hmmm?

               Indy stutters uncomfortably as Henry stares at him, waiting 
               for a response.

                                     INDY
                              (laughs)
                         Well... I can't think of anything.

                                     HENRY
                         Then what are you complaining about?
                              (laughs)
                         Look, we have work to do. When we 
                         get to Alexandretta we will face 
                         three challenges.
                              (he reads from the 
                              Diary)
                         "First, the breath of God. Only the 
                         penitent man will pass. Second, the 
                         Word of God, only in the footsteps 
                         of God will he proceed. Third, the 
                         Path of God, only in the leap from 
                         the lion's head will he prove his 
                         worth."

                                     INDY
                         What does that mean?

                                     HENRY
                              (laughs)
                         I don't know. We'll find out.

               Sunlight falls across the table from the window. Indy reaches 
               for the drink. The bar of sunlight turns like the hand of a 
               clock over the tabletop across the drinks.

               We see Indy puzzled. Only for a moment.

                                     INDY
                         They're turning around. They're taking 
                         us back to Germany.

               INT. FRAMEWORK OF ZEPPELIN - DAY

               Indy and his father emerge from the hatchway into the belly 
               of the Zeppelin. The Zeppelin's elaborate metal framework is 
               exposed.

               Indy and Henry hurry down the catwalk until arriving at a 
               PAIR OF DOORWAYS framed into the Zeppelin's outer skin.

                                     INDY
                         Well, I thought it would take them a 
                         lot longer to figure out the radio 
                         was dead. Come on, Dad. Move!

               Then Indy opens the doors. We see plenty of blue sky and 
               white clouds. We also see a small BI-PLANE that is suspended 
               from the Zeppelin by a HOOK & CRANE DEVICE.

                                     INDY
                         Come on, Dad. Come on!

               EXT. AIRPLANE - DAY

               Indy climbs into the cockpit of the Biplane as Henry takes 
               the tail gunner's seat.

                                     HENRY
                              (with delight)
                         I didn't know you could fly a plane.

                                     INDY
                         Fly... yes. Land... no.

               INT. THE BIPLANE - DAY

               Indy turns in his seat to give Henry the "thumbs up." Henry 
               smiles valiantly and points down to the ground.

               Then they both become aware of a STRANGE SOUND in the skies 
               behind them. Something between a ROAR and a WAIL. TWO 
               MESSERSCHMIDT FIGHTER BOMBERS streak out of the clouds and 
               race across the sky.

               INDY AND HENRY

               Shrink in their seats as the MESSERSCHMIDTS (going three 
               times as fast as they are) SCREAM past on either side.

                                     INDY
                         Dad, you're gonna have to use the 
                         machine gun. Get it ready.

               Henry turns and grips the MOUNTED MACHINE GUN with a perplexed 
               expression.

                                     INDY
                              (turning; pointing)
                         Eleven o'clock!

               Henry pulls out his watch.

                                     INDY
                         Dad -- eleven o'clock!!

                                     HENRY
                         What happens at eleven o'clock?

               Indy uses his arm to demonstrate that he's referring to a 
               direction and not a time.

                                     INDY
                              (frustrated)
                         Twelve -- eleven -- ten. Eleven 
                         o'clock. Fire!

               Henry does -- and the EXPLODING GUN nearly shakes him out of 
               his seat.

               Indy's slow speed and small size works to his advantage. The 
               speeding Messerschmidts continually overshoot him, WHIZZING 
               past in a blur -- making wide turns miles away in the sky.

               Henry has one of the Messerschmidts in his sight. He pulls 
               back on the trigger -- RATTA-A-TAT-TAT! RATTA-A-TAT-TAT!

               The Messerschmidt banks to the left, but Henry keeps it in 
               his gun sight. Henry swings the gun around, inadvertently 
               CUTTING HIS OWN REAR STABILIZER IN HALF.

                                     INDY
                         Dad, are we hit?!

                                     HENRY
                         More or less.
                              (pause)
                         Son, I'm sorry. They got us.

               Indy looks back at the missing tail section, then at his 
               father.

               The plane begins to go down. Indy struggles to control its 
               descent.

                                     INDY
                         Hang on, Dads We're going in!

               Henry slumps down fearfully in his seat.

               EXT. A FIELD - DAY

               The wheels of the plane touch down. OUT OF CONTROL, the PLANE 
               SKIDS and CRASHES first into a corral of goats and then into 
               the farmhouse beyond sending a cloud of dust into the air.

               As Indy pulls himself from the cockpit:

                                     HENRY
                              (sarcastic)
                         Nice landing.

                                     INDY
                         Thanks.

               Suddenly, Indy's attention is directed to:

               TWO SCREAMING MESSERSCHMIDTS

               Coming in low. Guns BLAZING.

               As BULLETS EXPLODE around them, Indy and Henry jump over a 
               stone barricade. Henry, frightened, grabs at Indy.

                                     HENRY
                         Those people are trying to kill us!

                                     INDY
                         I know, Dad!

                                     HENRY
                         It's a new experience for me.

                                     INDY
                         It happens to me all the time.

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               An OLD MAN kneels at his car repairing a rear tire.

               The Man turns to the wheel, the hubcap in his hands. Suddenly 
               the wheel moves forward, startling the Old Man.

               INT. THE CAR - TRAVELING - DAY

               Indy has the throttle down, both hands tightly gripping the 
               steering wheel. Henry is a very nervous passenger.

               Indy sees a LOW-FLYING MESSERSCHMIDT coming up behind him in 
               the SIDE MIRROR.

               As the Messerschmidt ROARS by overhead, BULLETS EXPLODE around 
               them, narrowly missing the car.

                                     HENRY
                         This is intolerable!

                                     INDY
                         This could be close.

               EXT. THE ROAD - LONG SHOT - DAY

               The car races toward a TUNNEL that cuts through a steep 
               MOUNTAINSIDE.

               The Messerschmidt bears down on Indy's car, machine guns 
               CHATTERING.

               The car ENTERS the tunnel. The Messerschmidt cannot pull up 
               in time. It SLAMS into the MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL, SHEARING OFF 
               its WINGS.

               INT. THE TUNNEL - DAY

               The FLAMING FUSELAGE continues to ROCKET through the tunnel 
               like a bullet down the muzzle of a gun. SPARKS fly as its 
               belly SCRAPES against the pavement and the sides of the 
               tunnel.

               INT. THE CAR - DAY

               Indy and Henry look over their shoulders to see this wingless 
               BALL OF FIRE gaining on them; about to overtake them.

                                     HENRY
                         Faster, boy -- faster!

               EXT. THE ROAD - OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN - DAY

               The car exits the tunnel at top speed and veers off the road. 
               The flaming Messerschmidt fuselage shoots past and EXPLODES 
               in the middle of the road.

               INT. THE CAR - DAY

               As the car emerges safely from the flames, Henry wipes the 
               sweat from his brow.

                                     HENRY
                         Well, they don't come any closer 
                         than that!

               Henry looks out the windshield and sees the second 
               Messerschmidt SCREAMING out of the sky toward them.

               EXT. THE ROAD - LONG SHOT - DAY

               The MESSERSCHMIDT drops its single UNDER-FUSELAGE BOMB. It 
               EXPLODES in the road directly ahead of the car, missing it 
               by only several feet.

               THE CAR

               FALLS INTO THE HOLE made by the bomb.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               Indy climbs out of the car, still in the bomb crater. He 
               turns back to Henry.

                                     INDY
                         Dad, he's coming back.

               Indy and Henry run down the mountainside to:

               DESERTED MEDITERRANEAN BEACH - DAY

               Indy and Henry run to the shoreline. Indy reaches for his 
               gun, tucked in his pants. He opens the chamber -- the GUN 
               HAS NO BULLETS.

               THE MESSERSCHMIDT

               Swings around and is coming in for another pass.

               INDY AND HENRY

               Exchange a wordless glance. They don't even think about 
               running: there is no place to run to. Henry hands his case 
               to Indy.

               Holding his umbrella, Henry suddenly spins around and runs 
               screaming and shouting into A FLOCK OF SEA GULLS...

               The SEA GULLS take to the wing in flight. Thousands of them.

               INDY

               Bullets kick up sand leading up to him... then --

               THE MESSERSCHMIDT AND THE SEA GULLS

               Meet in midair. MASSACRE! Sea gulls are shredded by the 
               Messerschmidt's whirling propeller blades into a FEATHERY 
               WHITE PUREE that SPLATTERS against the cockpit and CLOGS THE 
               ENGINE.

               ENGINE SPUTTERS... STALLS... Silence. The Messerschmidt falls 
               from the skies and EXPLODES in an OFF CAMERA SOUND EFFECT.

               Indy stands as before -- stunned -- a statue.

               Henry walks back to Indy.

                                     HENRY
                         I suddenly remembered Charlemagne. 
                         "Let my armies be the rocks and the 
                         trees and the birds in the sky."
                              (he chuckles)

               Indy wears a proud expression as he watches Henry walk down 
               the beach.

               EXT. MOSQUE - DAY

               FADE IN TITLE: "REPUBLIC OF HATAY"

               FADE OUT TITLE

               EXT. COURTYARD OF SULTAN'S PALACE - ISKENDERUN - DAY

               The Sultan is seated in his royal chair, flanked by Walter 
               Donovan and Vogel and surrounded by his minions.

               Donovan holds the missing Grail Diary pages.

                                     DONOVAN
                         These pages are taken from Professor 
                         Jones' diary, Your Highness. And 
                         they include a map that pinpoints 
                         the exact location of the Grail.

               Donovan and the Sultan walk together through an archway.

                                     DONOVAN
                         As you can see, the Grail is all but 
                         in our hands.
                              (beat)
                         However, Your Highness, we would not 
                         think of crossing your soil without 
                         your permission, nor of removing the 
                         Grail from your borders without 
                         suitable compensation.

                                     SULTAN
                         What have you brought?

                                     VOGEL
                         Bring den Schatz!

               TWO NAZI SOLDIERS bring forward a HUGE STEAMER TRUNK. They 
               open the lid and begin to empty it of its contents:

               Gold and silver objects of every description.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Precious valuables, Your Highness, 
                         "donated" by some of the finest 
                         families in all of Germany.

               The Sultan gets up from his chair and walks toward the trunk. 
               He goes right past it and begins to inspect the Nazi staff 
               car parked nearby.

                                     SULTAN
                         Rolls-Royce Phantom Two. 4.3 litre, 
                         30 horsepower, six cylinder engine, 
                         with Stromberg Downdraft carburetor.

               The Sultan points to the engine under the hood.

                                     SULTAN
                         Can go from zero to 100 kilometres 
                         an hour in 12.5 seconds. And I even 
                         like the color.

                                     DONOVAN
                              (after a beat)
                         The keys are in the ignition, Your 
                         Highness.

                                     SULTAN
                         You shall have camels, horses, an 
                         armed escort, provisions, desert 
                         vehicles -- and tanks!

                                     DONOVAN
                         You're welcome.

               Somebody else is also taking note... and we see that it is 
               Kazim, the spy at the court.

               Elsa is revealed coming down the stairs toward Donovan and 
               Vogel.

                                     ELSA
                         We have no time to lose. Indiana 
                         Jones and his father have escaped.

               EXT. ISKENDERUN STREET - DAY

               Sallah drives his car through the crowded streets, Indy beside 
               him and Henry in the back seat.

                                     SALLAH
                         We go this way.

               Sallah waves his arms and shouts to a CAMEL HERDER.

                                     SALLAH
                         Get that camel out of the way!

                                     INDY
                         What happened to Marcus, Sallah?

                                     SALLAH
                              (overlapping)
                         Ah, they set out across the desert 
                         this afternoon. I believe they took 
                         Mister Brody with them.

               Henry removes his hat and hits Indy with it.

                                     HENRY
                         Now they have the map! And in this 
                         sort of race, there's no silver medal 
                         for finishing second.

               EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

               Elsa and Donovan's party -- consisting of a SUPPLY TRUCK, 
               OPEN CAR, TURKISH SOLDIERS RIDING CAMELS, SPARE HORSES AND A 
               TANK AND VARIOUS OTHER VEHICLES -- all moving along through 
               the ramble of this box canyon.

               Elsa, Donovan and Vogel travel in the open car. The TANK is 
               a vintage World War I model with enormous treads. The Turkish 
               soldiers wear native dress and carry both carbines and sabers.

               Brody sits alongside Elsa in the rear of the car carrying 
               Donovan. Donovan hands a canteen back to him.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?

                                     BRODY
                         I'd rather spit in your face. But as 
                         I haven't got any spit...

               Vogel snatches the canteen away from Brody before he can 
               drink.

                                     VOGEL
                         We must be within three or four miles. 
                         Otherwise we are off the map.

               He hands the map to Elsa, drinks from the canteen, and hands 
               that back to Donovan.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of 
                         the recovery of the greatest artifact 
                         in the history of mankind.

                                     BRODY
                         You're meddling with powers you cannot 
                         possibly comprehend.

               Henry and Sallah are at Indy's side as he views Donovan's 
               party in the distance. Parked nearby is a CAR containing all 
               of their supplies.

                                     INDY
                         Ah, I see Brody. He seems okay. 
                         They've got a tank. Six-pound gun.

               Then Donovan notices a reflection from the hills.

               What he sees is:

               THE SUN REFLECTING OFF THE LENSES OF INDY'S BINOCULARS

                                     HENRY
                         What do you think you're doing?! Get 
                         down!

                                     INDY
                         Dad, we're well out of range.

               At that moment the tank FIRES A SHELL in their direction.

               It WHISTLES overhead and BLOWS UP THE PARKED CAR. Indy, Henry 
               and Sallah cover their heads as automobile fragments rain 
               down upon them.

                                     SALLAH
                         That car belonged to my brother-in-
                         law.

                                     INDY
                              (gesturing to the 
                              others)
                         Come on -- come on!

               EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

                                     VOGEL
                         I can't see anyone up there.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Maybe it wasn't even Jones.

                                     ELSA
                         No. It's him all right. He's here 
                         somewhere.

                                     DONOVAN
                              (to Vogel)
                         Put Brody in the tank.

               Kazim peers over a rock, pointing his rifle at the group 
               below.

                                     DONOVAN
                              (to Elsa)
                         Well, in this sun, without 
                         transportation, they're as good as 
                         dead.

               BULLETS EXPLODE off the vehicles and cliff. Donovan and Elsa 
               duck.

               A NAZI SOLDIER falls from the tank as BULLETS EXPLODE around 
               him.

               KAZIM'S MEN, BRETHREN OF THE CRUCIFORM SWORD, continue to 
               FIRE. Elsa and Donovan take cover beside the parked car.

                                     DONOVAN
                         It's Jones, all right.

               ANGLE ON INDY'S GROUP

               Indy and Henry, followed by Sallah, take cover behind a rock 
               to watch Kazim's Men and the Nazi Troops exchanging fire 
               below them.

                                     HENRY
                         Now, who are all these people?

                                     INDY
                         Who cares? As long as they're keeping 
                         Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here 
                         while Sallah and I organize some 
                         transportation.

               CUT BACK to the action. The BRETHREN are firing at the Donovan 
               party and are being fired on by the Donovan party.

               TWO NAZI SOLDIERS throw HAND GRENADES into the cliffs. They 
               EXPLODE, killing one of Kazim's Brethren.

               The battle continues -- a fierce exchange of GUNSHOTS, 
               GRENADES and MACHINE GUN FIRE with losses on both sides.

               INDY AND SALLAH

               Crouch behind a rock watching as men on both sides of the 
               battle run amongst camels and horses.

                                     INDY
                         I'm going after those horses.

                                     SALLAH
                         I'll take the camels.

                                     INDY
                         I don't need camels.

                                     SALLAH
                         But, Indy --

                                     INDY
                         No camels!

               DONOVAN AND ELSA

               They look down at Kazim who lies mortally wounded on the 
               ground at their feet. Elsa looks saddened.

                                     DONOVAN
                              (re: Kazim)
                         Who is he?

                                     KAZIM
                         A messenger from God. For the 
                         unrighteous, the Cup of Life holds 
                         everlasting damnation.

               Kazim dies.

               INDY

               Leaps atop a TURKISH SOLDIER on horseback, pulling the man 
               and the horse to the ground. A SECOND TURK comes to assist 
               his comrade; Indy mounts the horse, knocking both Turks to 
               the ground.

               INT. THE TANK - DAY

               Brody has been left alone in the tank. Henry climbs down 
               into the tank and taps Brody on the shoulder, startling him.

                                     HENRY
                         Marcus!

                                     BRODY
                         Arghhh! Oh!

               They exchange an old University Club toast, swinging their 
               arms at one another and missing. Then Henry flaps his arms 
               and tugs his ears.

                                     HENRY
                         "Genius of the Restoration --"

               Now Brody tugs his ears, flaps his arms and touches his head.

                                     BRODY
                         "-- aid our own resuscitation!"

               They exchange a handshake.

                                     BRODY
                         Henry! What are you doing here?!

                                     HENRY
                         It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.

               As Henry starts to climb out of the tank, TWO NAZI SOLDIERS 
               DROP DOWN from above, their Lugers drawn. They are followed 
               by Vogel.

                                     VOGEL
                              (re: Henry)
                         Search him.

               The Nazi Soldiers point their guns at Henry and Brody.

                                     VOGEL
                              (to Henry)
                         What is in this book? That miserable 
                         little Diary of yours!

               Vogel removes a glove and slaps Henry with it.

                                     VOGEL
                         Here's the map. The book is useless, 
                         and yet you come all the way back to 
                         Berlin to get it. Why?

               He slaps Henry again.

                                     VOGEL
                         What are you hiding?

               Another slap.

                                     VOGEL
                         What does the Diary tell you that it 
                         doesn't tell us?!

               Vogel reaches out to slap Henry yet again, but Henry grabs 
               his arm, stopping him.

                                     HENRY
                         It tells me that goose-stepping morons 
                         like yourself should try reading 
                         books instead of burning them.

               Donovan appears at the turret cover.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Colonel? Jones is getting away.

                                     VOGEL
                              (indicating Henry)
                         I think not, Herr Donovan.

               EXT. TANK - DAY

                                     DONOVAN
                         Not that Jones -- the other Jones!

                                     NAZI SOLDIER
                         Herr Colonel!

               EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

               Indy rides away on one horse, leading three others as he 
               goes.

               Sallah approaches on horseback leading five camels.

                                     INDY
                         Sallah, I said no camels! That's 
                         five camels. Can't you Count?

                                     SALLAH
                         Compensation for my brother-in-law's 
                         car. Indy, your father and Brody --

                                     INDY
                         Where's my father?

                                     SALLAH
                         They have them. In the belly of that 
                         steel beast.

               Indy and Sallah charge forward leading their horses and 
               camels.

               Then Vogel commands the Tank Driver to give chase.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               Vogel shouts to the Tank Driver.

                                     VOGEL
                         Fire!

               EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

               The tank starts firing at Indy on horseback. Indy zigs and 
               zags as the tank fires two rounds at Indy, barely missing 
               him. Each time Indy emerges from the plume of desert dust, 
               hanging like a toadstool in the air.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               Henry and Brody hold their hands over their ears.

               EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

               Donovan shouts orders to the Troops. Indy is followed by 
               various vehicles in the caravan.

               Indy notices that the side gun that is now firing at him can 
               only pivot so far. Indy makes a mental note of this and while 
               riding right in front of the tank, turns his horse completely 
               around, 180 degrees. The tank starts to follow.

               POV THROUGH THE VIEWING PORT

               Vogel watches the ground turning 180 degrees as he tries to 
               catch up with Indy.

               Cleverly, Indy has turned the tank directly into a head-on 
               collision course with some of the pursuit vehicles and a 
               Kubelwagon.

               The tank and the Kubelwagon smash into each other, the German 
               military sedan becoming lodged between the treads while 
               blocking the front view and any use of the six-pound cannon 
               on the turret.

               Indy, meanwhile, leans down on his horse, scooping up a stone 
               from the wall of a culvert. He reigns his horse, paralleling 
               the tank, as everyone scurries about inside, looking through 
               viewing ports, trying to figure out exactly where Indy is.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               Vogel shouts to the GUNNER.

                                     VOGEL
                         Den Kubelwagon sprengen!

               The Gunner puts a shell into the large gun. He FIRES, 
               CATAPULTING THE KUBELWAGON into the air, where it EXPLODES. 
               The tank drives through the resulting smoke an dust, then 
               rolls over the Kubelwagon, crushing it.

               EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

               Indy gallops up to the side cannon and jams the stone down 
               the barrel, lodging several rocks inside. Then he steers his 
               horse directly in range of that gun.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               A NAZI SOLDIER pushes Henry away from the window.

                                     NAZI SOLDIER
                         Keine Bewegung.

               He points his gun at Henry and Brody.

                                     NAZI SOLDIER
                         Keine Bewegung.

               The smaller gun, blocked by the rocks, BACKFIRES, blowing 
               the breech out into the face of the gunner, killing him and 
               filling the tank with smoke.

               Brody, Henry, Vogel and the driver begin to choke.

               EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

               Indy rides his horse alongside the tank.

                                     INDY
                         Dad! Dad! Dad!

               INT. TANK - DAY

               Henry and Brody still held at gunpoint by the Nazi Soldier.

                                     HENRY
                         Junior? Junior? Junior!

               The Nazi Soldier swings his fist, knocking Henry off his 
               seat.

               EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

               Smoke pours from the top of the tank as the turret pops open. 
               Vogel emerges and aims his gun at Indy.

               Indy and Vogel EXCHANGE SHOTS as Indy chases the tank on his 
               horse.

               Indy pulls the trigger again -- his gun is empty! Indy 
               immediately takes the high trail.

               Now Indy is above the tank twelve feet on a paralleling trail. 
               He moves out of the saddle and leaps from the speeding horse 
               onto the trundling tank.

               CLOSEUP - VOGEL

               Hate-staring at Indy.

               CLOSEUP - INDY

               Hate-staring back at Vogel.

               Suddenly, from nowhere a German soldier flies INTO FRAME, 
               tackling Indy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SIDE ANGLE

               One of the two troop carriers is paralleling the tank and 
               like pirates boarding a galleon, Nazi Soldiers leap over the 
               treads and are swarming all over Indy.

               Indy is struggling with a German's Luger.

               Indy presses the Luger against his assailant and forces the 
               Nazi to squeeze off a shot into himself. The bullet not only 
               passes through the Nazi, but passes through two other Nazis 
               standing directly behind him on the crowded tank top and 
               three bodies fall away, leaving Indy to stare at the gun in 
               disbelief.

               Another Soldier leaps from the truck onto the tank and raises 
               his knife as he grabs Indy. They struggle and fall.

               Indy sits up to see Vogel standing over him. Vogel wraps a 
               chain around Indy's neck.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               Indy appears at the entrance, the chain still wrapped about 
               his neck and held by Vogel.

                                     INDY
                         Dad!

               He drops the gun down into the tank.

                                     INDY
                         Dad! Dad! Get it!

               Vogel pulls Indy from the tank entrance, yanking on the chain 
               wrapped around his neck.

               EXT. TANK - DAY

               A NAZI SOLDIER approaches.

               Indy hits him, knocking him onto the tank tread. The Nazi 
               Soldier screams as he is dragged under the rolling tank.

               Now Indy and Vogel struggle with one another, the chain still 
               wrapped around Indy's neck.

               INT. TANK - DAY - THROUGH THE PERISCOPE

               We see Indy and Vogel struggling atop the tank. Indy lifts 
               his feet, lunging toward the periscope and pulling Vogel 
               with him.

               Indy's face is pressed up against the lens of the periscope.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               The Nazi Soldier looking through the periscope pulls away 
               from it, smiles, then turns back to it.

               THROUGH THE PERISCOPE

               Indy's face, still pressed against the lens.

               Vogel pulls Indy from the periscope.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               The Nazi Soldier pulls away from the periscope again.

                                     PERISCOPE SOLDIER
                              (laughing)
                         Diese Amerikaner. Sie kmpfen wie 
                         Weiber.

               EXT. TANK - DAY

               Indy now lies on top of Vogel. He kicks out at the periscope 
               which spins around.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               The periscope handle spins around and hits the PERISCOPE 
               SOLDIER in the head. He falls against the Nazi Soldier 
               guarding Henry and Brody.

               Henry pushes the Nazi Soldier aside and grabs the gun. The 
               Periscope Soldier struggles to take the gun from Henry.

               EXT. TANK - DAY

               Vogel holds the chain around Indy's neck, pushing his head 
               downward toward the revolving tread.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               The Periscope Soldier holds Henry from behind, forcing the 
               gun toward him. Henry reaches down and pulls a fountain pen 
               from his coat pocket.

               As the Periscope Soldier pulls on Henry's face, Henry lifts 
               the fountain pen and squirts ink into his face. The Soldier 
               falls, his head smashing into the wall of the tank. At the 
               same time, Henry loses his grip on the gun which falls to 
               the floor.

                                     BRODY
                         Henry, the pen --

                                     HENRY
                         What?

                                     BRODY
                         But don't you see? The pen is mightier 
                         than the sword.

               EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

               A troop truck pulls near the tank.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               Henry fires the TANK GUN at the troop truck. SOLDIERS FLY 
               INTO THE AIR. The TROOP TRUCK flips over and EXPLODES.

               EXT. TANK - DAY

               The EXPLOSION knocks Indy off the tank and onto the tread. 
               He grabs onto the shredded gun protruding from the side of 
               the tank.

               Vogel looks down at Indy and smiles smugly.

               The tank is approaching a cliff wall. As Indy tries to secure 
               footing, Vogel steps on his hands.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               Brody looks at Henry.

                                     BRODY
                         Look what you did!

                                     HENRY
                         It's war.

               EXT. TANK - DAY

               Vogel now swings a shovel at Indy, smashing at his hands.

               Brody climbs up out of the tank, followed by Henry.

                                     HENRY
                         Didn't I tell you it was a rescue, 
                         huh?

               A NAZI SOLDIER appears and pulls Henry down.

               Vogel raises the shovel above his head and brings it crashing 
               down on Indy, still hanging from the protruding gun.

               Indy loses his grip and now hangs from the gun suspended 
               only by the strap of his leather pouch. He screams as the 
               gun scrapes against the cliff wall, sending stones tumbling 
               down over him.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               The Nazi Soldier knocks Henry into a pile of boxes, then 
               punches him in the face.

               As the Soldier raises the gun to Henry's face, Brody hits 
               him over the head with a canister. The Soldier falls, 
               discharging the gun into the air.

               The BULLET RICOCHETS around the tank, past the Tank Driver 
               who is manipulating levers at the control panel. SPARKS FLY; 
               then the BULLET PINGS AGAINST THE WINDOW and RICOCHETS ONCE 
               MORE, this time passing THROUGH THE TANK DRIVER'S HAT. Blood 
               flows from under the hat as the Tank Driver slumps forward, 
               his body depressing the levers.

               EXT. TANK - DAY

               Indy still hangs from the strap of his leather pouch as the 
               tank swerves, barely missing the rocks and causing Vogel to 
               fall. Indy finally manages to pull himself atop the tank 
               once more where he punches Vogel over the side, then peers 
               down to Henry, still inside the tank.

                                     INDY
                         Dad?

                                     HENRY
                         You call this archaeology?

                                     INDY
                         Get out of there, Dad!

               Indy pulls Henry and Brody from the tank. Vogel pulls himself 
               back atop the tank armed again with the shovel which he swings 
               at Indy, who ducks and grabs Vogel's arm.

                                     BRODY
                         How does one get off this thing?

               As Indy winds up to punch Vogel he catches Brody in the face 
               on the backswing, then completes the movement and knocks 
               Vogel down.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               Vogel's hat sails in and falls to the floor.

               EXT. TANK - DAY

                                     HENRY
                              (to Indy)
                         Where's Marcus?!

               Before Indy can answer, Vogel is up and swinging with the 
               shovel. Indy ducks but the shovel catches Henry sending him 
               over the side and onto the moving tread.

               Indy grabs his whip, knocking Vogel aside.

               As Henry speeds toward the front of the tank to certain doom, 
               Indy, with lightning speed, whips out his bullwhip, wrapping 
               the end of the whip around Henry's right ankle.

                                     INDY
                         Dad!

               Henry is bouncing across the treads like a rag-doll. Indy 
               struggles to hold onto the end of the bullwhip.

                                     INDY
                         Hang on, Dad!

               Sallah draws his horse next to the treads. He tips his fez 
               to Henry.

                                     SALLAH
                         Father of Indy -- give me your hand!

               Vogel now punches Indy in the back and grabs him around the 
               neck. Still, Indy refuses to let go of the whip.

                                     INDY
                         Sallah! Get Dad!

               Sallah reaches out to Henry.

                                     SALLAH
                         Give me your hand!

               Sallah manages to hold onto Henry as he brings his horse to 
               a stop just at the cliff's edge.

               Indy finally frees himself of Vogel's grasp, twisting his 
               arm painfully away from Indy's neck, then landing a hard 
               blow to Vogel's head.

               INDY

               Looks down at the fast-approaching cliff, his face filled 
               with horror. We see his HAT BLOW OFF and sail over the cliff's 
               edge.

               VOGEL

               He sees his life passing before him, he screams at the top 
               of his lungs!

               LONG SHOT

               The tank trundles over the cliff and PLUMMETS TO THE BOTTOM.

               EXT. CLIFF EDGE - DAY

               Henry, Brody and Sallah look down at the flaming wreckage of 
               the tank.

                                     HENRY
                         Junior?!

               We HEAR the TANK EXPLODING.

                                     SALLAH
                         Indy?!

                                     HENRY
                         Oh, God. I've lost him. And I never 
                         told him anything. I just wasn't 
                         ready, Marcus. Five minutes would 
                         have been enough.

               And then... looking dazed and bewildered, Indy STAGGERS UP 
               BEHIND THEM. He joins the others at the edge of the cliff, 
               looking down at the wreckage below with a bewildered 
               expression.

               Finally, Henry becomes aware of his presence.

               Henry says nothing. He just looks at Indy, overcome with 
               emotion. Finally, he throws his arms around him.

                                     HENRY
                         I thought I'd lost you, boy.

               After a moment, Indy's head clears. And he becomes aware of 
               his father's embrace. Something he hasn't felt in a long 
               time -- if ever. And it touches him. He hugs his father back.

                                     INDY
                         I thought you had too, sir.

               Brody and Sallah are moved by this sudden reconciliation.

                                     HENRY
                         Well -- well done! Come on!

               Henry pats Indy on the back and Indy collapses, sitting hard 
               on the rocky cliff edge.

               Unaware, Henry, Sallah and Brody start to walk away. Henry 
               turns back to see Indy still sitting on the ground.

                                     HENRY
                         Let's go then. why are you sitting 
                         there resting when we're so near the 
                         end? Come on -- let's go!

               Henry turns and walks toward the horse with Brody and Sallah. 
               Suddenly the FEDORA, borne on the wind, BLOWS INTO SCENE and 
               lands at Indy's feet.

               EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

               Donovan peers through binoculars to see the CANYON OF THE 
               CRESCENT MOON. He lowers the binoculars and turns to Elsa.

                                     DONOVAN
                         The Canyon of the Crescent Moon.

               Now Elsa peers through the binoculars.

               EXT. SECRET CANYON - DAY

               Indy, Henry, Sallah and Brody ride into the canyon. They 
               hear a WAILING WIND. Feel the biting cold. And sense the 
               danger.

               Now we turn a corner and they see the hidden city. Its 
               spectacular Grecian facade is carved directly into the rock. 
               It is a stunning sight. The vehicles, camels and horses 
               belonging to Donovan's party have been left at the entrance.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TEMPLE - DAY

               Indy, Sallah, Henry and Brody creep forward to see:

               THE TERRIFIED FACE OF A TURKISH SOLDIER

               He's walking slowly. Eyes darting. Muttering a prayer under 
               his breath. What's going on here?

               FULL SHOT - INSIDE THE MOUNTAIN TEMPLE

               The Turk stands alone in the center of the Temple. It is 
               very dark. GIANT COLUMNS define the Temple's perimeter.

               ELSA AND DONOVAN

               Watch him from a safe distance.

               THE TURK

               Is about to approach the spot where a TURKISH SOLDIER LIES 
               DEAD. We don't notice it right away, but the dead soldier 
               has been DECAPITATED.

               The Turk stops -- only one step away from the beheaded 
               soldier.

               THE TURK

               Takes one more step -- a fatal step, it turns out. We hear a 
               ROAR -- A WHOOSH of air -- but we SEE NOTHING -- except THE 
               TURK'S HEAD FLY OFF AND BOUNCE across the ground.

               Indy, Henry, Brody and Sallah react to the sight.

               ELSA AND DONOVAN

               She looks at him, horrified.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Helmut, another volunteer!

               TWO NAZI SOLDIERS force another Turk forward. Suddenly...

               The SOUND OF RIFLE BOLTS being cocked. Everyone turns to 
               discover Indy and his party surrounded by NAZI SOLDIERS. 
               Indy's group are relieved of their guns.

               FULL SHOT - THE TEMPLE

               Indy, Henry, Brody and Sallah are brought forward by the 
               Nazi Soldiers.

               Elsa's eyes light up: glad Indy's not dead. She controls 
               herself and continues more coldly.

                                     ELSA
                              (to Indy)
                         I never expected to see you again.

                                     INDY
                         I'm like a bad penny. I always turn 
                         up.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Step back now, Doctor Schneider. 
                         Give Doctor Jones some room. He's 
                         going to recover the Grail for us.

               Indy laughs.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Impossible? What do you say, Jones? 
                         Ready to go down in history?

                                     INDY
                         As what? A Nazi stooge like you?

                                     DONOVAN
                              (scornfully)
                         Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your 
                         vision?! The Nazis want to write 
                         themselves into the Grail legend and 
                         take on the world. Well, they're 
                         welcome. But I want the Grail itself. 
                         The cup that gives everlasting life. 
                         Hitler can have the world, but he 
                         can't take it with him. I'm going to 
                         be drinking my own health when he's 
                         gone the way of the Dodo.
                              (he draws his pistol)
                         The Grail is mine, and you're going 
                         to get it for me.

                                     INDY
                         Shooting me won't get you anywhere.

                                     DONOVAN
                         You know something, Doctor Jones? 
                         You're absolutely right.

               Then Donovan shifts his aim, just a bit, and SHOOTS Henry. 
               The bullet enters his side below the ribs.

                                     INDY
                         Dad?!

                                     HENRY
                         Junior...

                                     ELSA
                         No!!

                                     DONOVAN
                              (to Elsa)
                         Get back!

               Henry collapses. Blood flowing from the wound. Brody and 
               Sallah rush to his assistance.

               Indy spins toward Donovan with murder in his eyes.

               Donovan points the gun at him:

                                     DONOVAN
                         You can't save him when you're dead.

               Indy hesitates.

                                     DONOVAN
                         The healing power of the Grail is 
                         the only thing that can save your 
                         father now. It's time to ask yourself 
                         what you believe.

               Indy takes in the situation. The two decapitated men lie a 
               few yards in front of him. He walks to the entranceway, 
               flanked by two stone lions. We get silent reaction shots -- 
               Elsa -- Sallah -- Brody -- Donovan -- registering their 
               different emotions

               Indy proceeds forward. His hands open the Grail Diary.

                                     INDY
                         "The Breath of God... Only the 
                         penitent man will pass. Only the 
                         penitent man will pass..."

               Indy takes a few steps forward.

                                     INDY
                         "The penitent man will pass. The 
                         penitent man..."

               Indy stops. He is about to reach the spot where two men have 
               just died.

               Henry looks at Indy. Indy looks at Henry.

                                     HENRY
                              (in a raspy voice)
                         "Only the penitent man will pass. 
                         Only the penitent man will pass."

                                     INDY
                              (quietly to himself)
                         The penitent man will pass. The 
                         penitent... the penitent. The penitent 
                         man...

                                     HENRY
                         The penitent man. The penitent...

               Indy takes a step forward through the cobwebs.

                                     INDY
                         The penitent man is humble before 
                         God.

                                     HENRY
                         Penitent. Penitent...

                                     INDY
                         The penitent man is humble...

               The cobwebs begin to move...

                                     INDY
                         He kneels before God.
                              (to himself; suddenly)
                         Kneel!!

               We hear the awful rush of air -- WHOOSH! Because Indy is in 
               the act of kneeling, only his hat is knocked off and his 
               hair flies in his face.

               Instinctively he ROLLS FORWARD on the ground out of harm's 
               way and looks up. From his new position he is able to see 
               what is causing all the trouble: A RAZOR SHARP TRIPLE 
               PENDULUM.

               Indy gets cautiously to his feet. Now he sees the pendulum 
               has been guarding a SMALL CORRIDOR which turns a corner to 
               the left fifty yards ahead. Wooden wheels turn -- the 
               mechanism controlling the spinning blades. Indy loops a rope 
               around the wheels, jamming the mechanism and stopping the 
               blades in mid-swipe.

                                     INDY
                         I'm through!

               ELSA AND DONOVAN

                                     DONOVAN
                         We're through!

               Brody and Sallah smile, relieved.

                                     SALLAH
                              (to Henry)
                         He's all right.

               Henry shakes his head.

                                     HENRY
                         No.

               BACK TO INDY

               Holding the Grail Diary, reading once again, his fedora now 
               covered in cobwebs.

                                     INDY
                         "The second challenge is the Word of 
                         God. Only in the footsteps of God 
                         will he proceed."
                              (to himself)
                         The Word of God... The Word of...

               Indy pulls away some cobwebs to reveal a cobblestone path. 
               Each cobble is engraved with a letter.

                                     INDY
                         "Proceed in the footsteps of the 
                         Word."

               HENRY

               Lifts his head painfully.

                                     HENRY
                         The Word of God...

                                     BRODY
                         No, Henry. Try not to talk.

                                     HENRY
                         The Name of God...

               BACK TO INDY

               As he studies the cobblestones before him.

                                     INDY
                         The Name of God... Jehovah!

               HENRY

               Still lies in Sallah's arms. Brody leans over him.

                                     HENRY
                         But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" 
                         begins with an "I".

               BACK TO INDY

                                     INDY
                         "J".

               Indy takes a step and immediately a stone breaks away and 
               Indy falls up to his hip -- his leg stuck through the hold 
               where the stone once was.

               HENRY

               Reacts.

                                     HENRY
                         Oh dear!

               BACK TO INDY

               Who grunts as he pulls himself from the hole, the Grail Diary 
               in his hand.

                                     INDY
                         In Latin, "Jehovah" starts with an 
                         "I". "I"...

               Now we see each letter on the stones as Indy carefully walks 
               forward. Donovan and Elsa follow in his footsteps.

                                     INDY
                         "E"... "H"... "O"... "V"... "A"...

               Indy sighs with relief and steps forward to:

               THE GREAT ABYSS

               Indy stands in a small opening, just small enough for his 
               shoulders to squeeze through and beyond that a 100 foot drop 
               to the rocks below and 100 feet across, nothing but a rough, 
               stony cliff wall.

               BACK TO INDY

               He can see nowhere to cross. He looks again to the Grail 
               Diary.

                                     INDY
                         "The path of flood. Only in the leap 
                         from the lion's head will he prove 
                         his worth."

               Indy looks around and then he notices that inscribed into 
               the rock above his head is the head of a lion.

                                     INDY
                         Impossible! Nobody can jump this!

               Indy looks down into the Diary and tortures over what it is 
               asking him to do.

               BRODY

               Rushes forward and calls to Indy.

                                     BRODY
                         Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come 
                         quickly!

               BACK TO INDY

                                     INDY
                              (realizing)
                         It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.

               HENRY

               Calls to his son.

                                     HENRY
                         You must believe, boy. you must... 
                         believe.

               We see him do it. We see him leap into space. We see that he 
               is in midair. We see that he is not going to make it. His 
               hands claw for the opposite wall but he is going to fall 100 
               feet to his death. And then -- he doesn't! He appears to be 
               held up by thin air as he lands on his hands and knees.

               Indy looks around and down and now he figures it out.

               Ingeniously, the First Crusaders have painted a pathway to 
               align with the rocks 100 feet below. It is a perfect forced 
               perspective image of the rocks below with lines from a hundred 
               feet continuing six feet below his sight line where his feet 
               are stepping.

               It's painted to blend in with the rocks below. Highly evolved 
               camouflage... in perfect alignment with everything we see 
               below.

               When Indy leans out to the left or right... that's when he 
               sees the perfect alignment shift that betrays the trick. 
               Indy throws some dirt on the bridge and he crosses it like 
               the first Crusader from the painting over Henry's desk.

               Indy crawls through a small opening in the side of the cliff 
               and enters a Temple.

               A vast array of chalices is displayed on the altar of this 
               small Temple. Perhaps a hundred or more. Many sizes, many 
               shapes, some gold, some silver, but they all glitter and 
               shine.

               Indy is mesmerized by their number and their beauty. And 
               then he realizes that a man is praying at the altar!

               He has his back turned to Indy... but he is dressed as what 
               he is! A GRAIL KNIGHT.

               CLOSE ON THE GRAIL KNIGHT

               But we can't see the Grail Knight's face. The visor of his 
               helmet is down. Perhaps we see his eyes.

               When the Grail Knight sees Indy he gets wearily to his feet 
               and, surprisingly, prepares to give combat... taking up his 
               two-handed broadsword... he comes at Indy, attempting to 
               swing the huge, heavy sword but finding the effort almost 
               too much. Indy dodges two or three clumsy swings of the sword, 
               making no attempt to fight back... until the Knight, 
               exhausted, drops the sword and collapses. Indy approaches 
               him and raises the visor and we see that the Knight is a 
               very ancient man.

                                     KNIGHT
                         I knew you'd come, but my strength 
                         has left me.

                                     INDY
                         Who are you?

                                     KNIGHT
                         The last of three brothers who swore 
                         an oath to find the Grail and to 
                         guard it.

                                     INDY
                         That was seven hundred years ago.

                                     KNIGHT
                         A long time to wait.

               The Grail Knight reaches forward and fingers Indy's clothing.

                                     KNIGHT
                         You're strangely dressed... for a 
                         knight.

                                     INDY
                         I'm not exactly... a knight. What do 
                         you mean?

                                     KNIGHT
                         I was chosen because I was the bravest 
                         and the most worthy. The honor was 
                         mine until another came to challenge 
                         me to single combat. I pass it to 
                         you who vanquished me.

               The Grail Knight holds his sword out to Indy.

                                     INDY
                              (gulp)
                         Listen, I don't have time to explain, 
                         but --

               At that moment Donovan and Elsa appear. Donovan turns to 
               face the display of cups.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Which one is it?

                                     KNIGHT
                         You must choose.
                              (beat)
                         But choose wisely. For as the True 
                         Grail will bring you life -- the 
                         False Grail will take it from you.

                                     DONOVAN
                         I'm not a historian. I have no idea 
                         what it looks like. Which one is it?

                                     ELSA
                         Let me choose.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Thank you, Doctor.

               Elsa and Indy exchange looks. He thinks he is seeing her in 
               her true colors.

               Elsa chooses a cup -- a solid gold, emerald encrusted goblet.

               Donovan instantly takes it from her.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Oh, yes. It's more beautiful than 
                         I'd ever imagined. This certainly is 
                         the cup of the King of Kings.

               Donovan rushes to the well and fills the goblet with water.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Eternal life!

               Donovan drinks from the goblet.

               Then, Donovan's entire body starts to convulse. His face 
               contorts in agony. He grabs his stomach and turns toward 
               Elsa.

                                     DONOVAN
                         What... is... happening... to... 
                         me...?

               He starts to age -- fast! His hair grows long and gray and 
               brittle. His face sinks. Fingernails curl back on themselves. 
               Milky cataracts coat his eyes.

               Elsa gasps and screams.

                                     DONOVAN
                         What... is... happening...?

               His skin turns brown and leathery and stretches across his 
               bones until it splits. His skeletal hands reach for Elsa's 
               throat, choking her.

               Indy rushes forward and pushes Donovan away. As he falls he 
               BODY BREAKS INTO FLAMES, then SHATTERS AGAINST THE WALL.

                                     KNIGHT
                         He chose... poorly.

               Indy studies the array of chalices.

                                     ELSA
                         It would not be made out of gold.

               Indy picks up another cup, a simple earthenware jug.

                                     INDY
                         That's the cup of a carpenter.

               He and Elsa exchange a look.

                                     INDY
                         There's only one way to find out.

               Indy goes to the well and fills the earthenware jug with 
               water, then pauses. Indy brings the jug to his lips and takes 
               several large swallows.

               A strange sensation overcomes him, a feeling of peace and 
               contentment... and we see his wounds begin to heal.

                                     KNIGHT
                         You have chosen wisely. But the Grail 
                         cannot pass beyond the Great Seal. 
                         That is the boundary and the price 
                         of immortality.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BRODY AND SALLAH

               Who attend to Henry awaiting Indy's return.

               Indy and Elsa come forward with the Grail.

               The TWO NAZI SOLDIERS are over-awed by the possessors of the 
               Grail. They put down their guns and kneel.

               Indy kneels by Henry's side and tilts his head forward and 
               holds the Grail to his lips.

               Henry is too weak to even open his eyes.

               Henry swallows some of the water. Much of it runs down the 
               corners of his mouth. Finally Indy pours the water over the 
               wound and everyone watches in astonishment as the wound and 
               the blood stain disappear before their eyes. The color returns 
               to Henry's face.

               Henry's eyes open. The first thing he sees is the Grail and 
               they light up. Then they shift to Indy's face -- and they 
               light up even more...

               NAZI SOLDIERS run forward. Sallah points a rifle at them.

                                     SALLAH
                         Drop your guns. Please.

               The Nazi Soldiers drop their weapons at their feet and raise 
               their arms in surrender.

                                     INDY
                              (to Henry)
                         Dad, come on. Get to your feet.

               ELSA

               Steps forward and picks up the Grail. She turns to Indy, her 
               face alight with possession of the Grail.

                                     ELSA
                         We have got it. Come on.

               Elsa steps onto the edge of the Great Seal.

                                     INDY
                         Elsa! Elsa, don't move!

                                     ELSA
                         It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.

                                     INDY
                         Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The Knight 
                         warned us not to take the Grail from 
                         here.

               A RUMBLING SOUND IS HEARD and the ground roars and shifts. 
               Dirt falls from the ceiling of the cavern. Elsa falls on the 
               Great Seal. The Grail bounces away from her grasp. She reaches 
               for it and the ground beneath her begins to SPLIT OPEN. Elsa 
               slips into the crevasse. She screams.

               Elsa is hanging perilously in the abyss, with the Grail almost 
               within her reach. As her hands lose their grip, Indy just 
               manages to grab one of them, he himself sliding forward across 
               the slanted floor.

                                     HENRY
                         Junior! Junior!

               With her free hand, Elsa is trying to get the Grail. Indy 
               can't save her unless she gives him her free hand. She has 
               to choose.

                                     INDY
                         Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give 
                         me your other hand, honey. I can't 
                         hold you.

                                     ELSA
                         I can reach it. I can reach it...

               Her hand begins to slip from Indy's grasp.

                                     INDY
                         Elsa! Give me your hand. Give me 
                         your other hand!

               Elsa just manages to touch the Grail. In doing so, she has 
               tipped the balance too far -- Indy slides down another yard, 
               Elsa loses her grip and falls screaming to her death.

                                     INDY
                              (horrified)
                         Elsa!!

               Now the ledge Indy lies upon begins to break apart. Henry 
               grabs one of his hands as Indy struggles to reach the Grail 
               with the other.

                                     HENRY
                         Junior, give me your other hand! I 
                         can't hold on!!

                                     INDY
                         I can get it -- I can almost reach 
                         it, Dad.

               Indy looks down into the black bottomless pit beneath him 
               from which nothing can ever be retrieved.

                                     HENRY
                         Indiana. Indiana!!

               Indy snaps his look up to his father. His father has never 
               called him this before.

                                     HENRY
                              (very calmly)
                         ...let it go...

               Indy abandons the Grail and grabs onto Henry with both hands. 
               Henry pulls him up to safety.

               THE GRAIL KNIGHT

               Looks through the falling debris to Indy and Henry. Sallah 
               and Brody rush from the crumbling Temple.

                                     INDY
                         Dad...

               The Grail Knight raises his arm to Henry.

                                     INDY
                         Please, Dad...

               Indy and Henry down the passageway just as a huge stone column 
               tumbles down upon the spot where they stood. The Grail Knight 
               lowers his arm as he watches them leave.

               EXT. ENTRANCE TO MOUNTAIN TEMPLE - AFTERNOON

               Indy, Henry, Sallah and Brody emerge from the Mountain Temple 
               through the Grecian Facade.

               From within the Mountain Temple, the ROAR OF WALLS CAVING IN 
               IS HEARD. A cloud of dust and smoke billows out from the 
               entrance.

               Henry turns to Indy.

                                     HENRY
                         Elsa never really believed in the 
                         Grail. She thought she'd found a 
                         prize.

                                     INDY
                         What did you find, Dad?

                                     HENRY
                         Me?... Illumination.

               Henry and Indy mount their horses. Henry turns back to his 
               son.

                                     HENRY
                         What did you find, Junior?

                                     INDY
                         Junior?! Dad...

                                     SALLAH
                         Please... What does it always mean, 
                         this... this "Junior?"

                                     HENRY
                         That's his name. Henry Jones, Junior.

                                     INDY
                         I like Indiana.

                                     HENRY
                         We named the dog Indiana.

                                     BRODY
                         May we go home now, please?

                                     SALLAH
                              (to Indy)
                         The dog!?
                              (laughs)
                         You are named after the dog...

                                     INDY
                              (embarrassed)
                         I've got a lot of fond memories of 
                         that dog.

               A moment passes as they all ready their mounts and Sallah 
               continues to laugh at Indy.

                                     INDY
                         Ready?

                                     HENRY
                         Ready.

                                     BRODY
                         Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the 
                         way!
                              (to his horse)
                         Haaa!

                                     HENRY
                              (to Indy)
                         Got lost in his own museum, huh?

                                     INDY
                         Uh-huh.

                                     HENRY
                         After you, Junior.

                                     INDY
                         Yes, sir!
                              (to his horse)
                         Haaa!

               EXT. THE SECRET CANYON - AFTERNOON

               They THUNDER through the canyon -- whose towering walls 
               threaten to collapse upon them.

               EXT. ENTRANCE TO CANYON - SUNSET

               As Brody, Indy, Henry and Sallah ride from the canyon toward 
               the SETTING SUN.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
