                             A WORD ABOUT THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS OF THIS SCRIPT
    
                Many people tend to use terms like "universe" and "cosmos" and galaxy 
                rather loosely. This script will remain true to the STAR TREK trad-
                ition of scientific reality. With a few possible exceptions, the STAR 
                TREK series and films take place within our own galaxy. The galaxy is 
                vast, but finite (as opposed to the universe which is infinite). As 
                Gene Roddenberry has pointed out, ony 115 of this galaxy will have 
                been explored by the 23rd Century.
    
                Because the galaxy is finite, however, it has a center. It is unlikely 
                that by the time of this tale, this central are, distant and dangerous, 
                will have been explored. Nor can anyone say for sure what we may find 
                there.
    
                These basic assumptions evolve from our on-going discussions with the 
                staff of I.P.A.C. (Infrared Processing and Analysis Center) of JPL/Cal 
                Tech. Their incredible computer graphics, obtained by advanced infra-             
                red satellite telescope photography, will be made available to use to 
                enhance not only the accuracy, but the incredible beauty of this 
                latest STAR TREK voyage.

                       Shimmering waves of heat. A flat unforgiving landscape 
                       stretches to infinity. A storm of dust gathers on the 
                       horizon, small at first, increasing in size as it 
                       rolls toward us. Hoofbeats fill the soundtrack. Just 
                       as the storm threatens to engulf us, A RIDER ON 
                       HORSEBACK emerges.

                       A twisted rhino horn juts from the snout of this odd 
                       creature. The Rider spurs the beast, driving it onward. 
                       His white robes flare out behind him like the wings 
                       of an avenging angel. He rides like a man possessed.

                       Camera pans an arid expanse of scorched earth. J'ONN, 
                       a ragged and malnourished homesteader of some alien 
                       race, toils beneath a blazing sun, his back to camera. 
                       He sinks an augering device into the ground, drilling 
                       in vain for water. There are many hundreds
                       of holes in the earth around him.
    
                       J'onn reacts to the clop of approaching hooves. He 
                       tenses, then whirls around clutching a crude home-made 
                       pipe gun.

                       J'onn raises his pipe gun and fires a warning shot. 
                       The Rider reins his horse to a halt ten feet short 
                       of J'onn. The beast snorts and stamps its hooves 
                       impatiently while the Rider studies the frightened 
                       homesteader and removes a breathing device from his 
                       mouth. Finally, he speaks.
    
                                               RIDER
                                 I thought weapons were forbiddeen on 
                                 this planet.
    
                       The Rider swings down from the saddle. He's tall, power-
                       fully built beneath his dusty robs, his face shadowed by 
                       a hood. He indicates their bleak surroundings.
    
                                               RIDER
                                         (continuing)
                                 Besides, I can't believe you'd kill 
                                 me for a field of empty holes.
    
                                               J'ONN
                                         (pathetic)
                                 It's all I have.
    
                       J'onn sags under the futile weight of his existence. 
                       The Rider approaches him without fear. He gently 
                       removes the weapon from J'onn's trembling hands. It's 
                       all the homesteader can do to keep from sobbing.
    
                                               RIDER
                                 Your pain runs deep.
    
                                               J'ONN
                                         (turns away in 
                                          embarrassment)
                                 What do you know of my pain?
    
                                               RIDER
                                 Let us explore it together.
    
                       The Rider collects himself and concentrates deeply. 
                       J'onn is immediately transfixed. He begins to tremble. 
                       Tears flood his dirty cheeks.
    
                                               RIDER
                                         (continuing; soothing
                                          tone)
                                 Each man hides a secret pain. It must 
                                 be exposed and reckoned with. It must 
                                 be hauled from the darkness and 
                                 forced into the light. Share your 
                                 pain with me and gain strength from 
                                 it.
    
                      J'onn whimpers and cries out in anguish. Finally, the 
                      catharis ends. J'onn drops to his knees, then looks up. 
                      He opens his eyes and blinks in wonder and amazement 
                      at the Rider. The Rider helps him to his feet.

                                          the words)
                                 I feel as if a weight has been lifted 
                                 from my heart. How can I repay you 
                                 for this miracle?
    
                                               RIDER
                                 Join my quest.

                                 sought since time began -- the 
                                 ultimate knowledge. To find it, we'll 
                                 need a starship.

                                 A starship? There are no starships on

                                 But how?
    
                                               RIDER
                                 Have faith my friend. There are more 
                                 of us than you know.

                       or equipment. Just man against mountain. Using the

                       He inserts the pads of two fingers into a narrow crack 
                       above his head. He exhales, focusing concentration. 
                       Kirk pulls himself up, balancing on a ledge barely an 
                       inch wide. Exhilarated, he pauses to admire the view.

                       Yosemite. This may be the 23rd Century but the park 
                       looks the same as it did three hundred years ago. There 
                       is a soft whooshing sound and SPOCK suddenly rises into 
                       frame.

                       Spock hovers in mid-air along side the startled Kirk, 
                       kept aloft by means of levitation boots. His hands 
                       are clasped behind his back, typically Spock-like.

                       Kirk slips but manages to gain a handhold and save 
                       himself. Beneath his feet a mini-avalanche of rocks 
                       is dislodged, tumbling to the valley below.

                       from the back, steps into the squalid bar. The Bar-
                       tender jerks his thumb in the direction of the back 
                       room. The stranger crosses to the back room door and 
                       dissapears inside. Talk and noise resume.
    
                  33   INT. BACK ROOM                                                33
    
                       The stranger lowers the breathing device from her face 
                       and is revealed to be a young woman. A Romulan. Her 
                       name is CAITHLIN DAR and she stands on the threshold 
                       of the room, trying to adjust her eyes to the murky 
                       surroundings. She's a little nervous and a long way 
                       from home.
    
                       The back room is an area for unwanted odds and ends. A
                       ceiling fan swishes overhead pushing hot air around. 
                       TWO MEN are sprawled in chairs at opposite ends of a 
                       table. They're too busy drinking to notice Caithlin's 
                       entrance.
    
                                               CAITHLIN
                                 Gentlemen, I'm Caithlin Dar.
    
                       The man seated closest to Caithlin slowly swivels his 
                       head in her direction. He wearily extracts himself 
                       from his chair and comes forward. He's a Terran (spec-
                       ifically, an Englishman) named ST. JOHN TALBOT. Thin 
                       and dissipated, alcoholic, Talbot is a veteran of the 
                       diplomatic corps. He pats down his unruly hair and
                       straightens his soiled suit. He gives Caithlin a tired 
                       smile and extends a limp hand.
    
                                               TALBOT
                                 Ah, yes. Our new Romulan represent-
                                 ative. Welcome to Paradise City, Miss 
                                 Dar, capital of the so-called "Planet 
                                 of Galactic Peace." I'm St. John 
                                 Talbot, the Federation representative 
                                 here on Nimbus III and my charming 
                                 companion is the Klingon consul 
                                 Korrd...
    
                       Caithlin regards the hulking figure on the other end 
                       of the table. KORRD is an old, overweight Klingon, a 
                       once great warrior now past his prime. He doesn't 
                       rise to greet Caithlin. Instead, he takes a swig from 
                       a flagon and emits an earth-shaking belch.
    
                                               CAITHLIN
                                 I expect that's Klingon for hello.
    
                       Reacting to Korrds stench, Caithlin holds her breathing 
                       device in front of her mouth.
    
                                               TALBOT
                                 He doesn't speak English.
    
                                               CAITHLIN
                                 And I don't speak Klingon.
    
                                               TALBOT
                                 I'm relieved to hear that. Please sit 
                                 down Miss Dar. Can I offer you a 
                                 drink?
    
                       Caithlin brushes the dust from a chair at the opposite 
                       end of the table from Korrd.
    
                                               CAITHLIN
                                         (boldly)
                                 I must say I'm shocked at what I've 
                                 seen. Hunger. Poverty. No law enforce-
                                 ment. And here the two of you sit 
                                 drinking...
    
                       Without warning, Korrd drunkenly lets loose with a 
                       barrage of his native tongue. (It is subtitled in 
                       English for those who don't speak Klingon.)
    
                                               KORRD
                                 (Romulan woman belong on their backs.)
    
                                               CAITHLIN
                                 What did he say?
    
                                               TALBOT
                                 He says he hopes you'll enjoy your 
                                 tour of duty here. Might I ask, Miss 
                                 Dar, what terrible thing you did to 
                                 get yourself banished to this armpit 
                                 of the galaxy?
    
                                               CAITHLIN
                                 I volunteered.
    
                                               TALBOT
                                         (spewing grog)
                                 _Volunteered_.
    
                       Talbot turns to Korrd and translates her answer into 
                       Klingon. Korrd chortles derisively.
    
                                               CAITHLIN
                                 Nimbus III is a great experiment. 
                                 Twenty years ago when our three 
                                 governments agreed to develop this 
                                 planet together, a new age was born.
    
                                               TALBOT
                                 Your new age died a quick death. The 
                                 great drought put an end to it. And 
                                 the settlers we conned into coming 
                                 here -- the dregs of the galaxy. 
                                 They immediately took to fighting 
                                 amongst themselves. We forbade them 
                                 weapons -- they fashioned their own.
    
                                               CAITHLIN
                                 Then it appears I've arrived just in 
                                 time. The policies that the three of 
                                 us agree on will have far-reaching 
                                 results...
    
                                               TALBOT
                                 My dear girl, we're not here to agree. 
                                 We're here to disagree. This "great 
                                 experiment" as you call it was 
                                 instigated to satisfy a bunch of 
                                 bleeding hearts whining for "galactic 
                                 peace." It was intended to fail.
    
                                               CAITHLIN
                                 I'm afraid I don't share that view.
    
                                               TALBOT
                                         (pleased)
                                 There, you see? We are disagreeing 
                                 already.
    
                                               CAITHLIN
                                 I'm here to open discussions for a 
                                 solution to these problems.
    
                       Korrd comes to life. He roars with laughter and spits 
                       back a disgusting mouthful of Klingon. Talbot winces.
    
                                               CAITHLIN
                                         (losing patience)
                                 What did he say? I want his exact 
                                 words.
    
                                               TALBOT
                                 He said the only thing he'd like to 
                                 open is your blouse. He's heard 
                                 Romulan women are different.
    
                       Caithlin's embarrassment turns to anger.
    
                                               CAITHLIN
                                 You tell Consul Korrd -- never mind. 
                                 I'll tell him myself in the only 
                                 Klingon I know.
    
                       Caithlin let's loose with a Klingon epithet. No trans-
                       lation necessary. Sputtering with rage, Korrd hurls 
                       his flagon aside and clambers to his feet.
    
                                               KORRD
                                         (in perfect English)
                                 _Screw you too_!
    
                                               CAITHLIN
                                 He _does_ speak English!
    
                                               TALBOT
                                         (surprised)
                                 Sly old bugger!
    
                       Further argument is interrupted by shouts from outside 
                       and the whine of a warning klaxon.
    
                       A handful of sentries brace themselves against the gate. 
                       It suddenly gives way. Camera climbs up over the top 
                       of the arch to reveal Sybok's army on the threshold 
                       of the city. In their midst, towering majestically 
                       above them, is Sybok on horseback. He urges his mount 
                       forward. With quiet determination, he and his army pour
                       under the arch and proceed up the main drag.
    
                       Townspeople scurrying for protection, anticipating an 
                       attack. Those who consider challenging Sybok are 
                       allayed by the crude weapons and intimidating looks 
                       of his followers. Sybok intends to take this town by 
                       show of force without having to fire a shot. And it
                       looks like he'll succeed.

                  35   EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SALOON                                    35
    
                       Korrd, Caithlin and Talbot emerge to see what the hub-
                       bub is about. When they see the approaching forces, 
                       Korrd and Talbot immediately turn tail and run back 
                       inside. After a moment, Caithlin follows.
    
                  36   INT. SALOON                                                   36
    
                       Korrd, fearing the worst, goes behind the bar and 
                       opens a bottle. He upends it and pours the contents 
                       down his throat. He prefers to die drunk.
    
                       Talbot runs to the far side of the room and yanks a 
                       dusty sheet off a primitive communications screen. 
                       Caithlin rushes to his side as he desperately tries 
                       to get it working.
    
                       The saloon doors are forced open. J'onn and several 
                       soldiers pour in, brandishing weapons.
    
                                               J'ONN
                                 Get away from that screen!
    
                       The klaxon winds down to eerie silence as the soldiers 
                       herd Korrd, Caithlin and Talbot together. Sybok enters.
    
                                               SYBOK
                                         (appraising them
                                          one by one)
                                 Romulan. Terran. Klingon. Consider 
                                 yourselves my prisoners.

                                 this worthless ball of rock. Of what 
                                 possible value could we be to you?

                                 rock, but it does have one unique 
                                 treasure. It's the only place in the 
                                 entire galaxy that has the three of 
                                 you.
    
                       Korrd reaches for the pistol at his side. But before 
                       his fingers can grasp it, Sybok's soldiers noisily 
                       cock their weapons and point them at his heart. Korrd 
                       is outgunned and he knows it. He sputters impotently.

                                 want but I can tell you this: our

                       Hanging in space like a big Christams ornament. The

                       A huge, cavernous area designed as a high and dry for 
                       space vessels. Among this warehouse of ships is the

                       A meager repair crew lazily overhauls consoles and 
                       monitors. Some things work, most do not. One thing 
                       that _does_ work is CHIEF ENGINEER MONTGOMERY SCOTT 
                       who looks up as COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER UHURA enters, 
                       stepping around cables.

                                 said. And then we found out, didn't 
                                 we?

                                 I had a feeling you'd say something 
                                 like that. So...

                       Uhura goes to her console to switch it off but sees 
                       something odd. She punches a button and responds.

                       COMMANDER SULU and CHEKOV tramp through dense woods. 
                       From their weary expressions, its clear they've been 
                       hiking a long time. Sulu leads the way, Chekov

                                 and we're starving.
    
                       McCoy grins and crouches beside the covered pot. He 
                       revels in their undivided attention.

                                 _Beans_, Spock -- but no ordinary beans. 
                                 These are from an old Southern recipe 
                                 handed down to me by my father. And 
                                 if you turn your Vulcan nose at 
                                 these, you're not just insulting me, 
                                 you're insulting countless gener-

                       McCoy ladles out the beans. Kirk tears into his. Spock 
                       tries a forkful. He finds the taste strangely exciting.

                                 Surprisingly good. However, it contains 
                                 a flavoring I am not familiar with.

                       Spock eats with enthusiasm.

                       McCoy grins and pulls out a bottle of bourbon. Spock 
                       stops in mid-chew and McCoy fills Kirk's cup.

                       notices that Spock has removed a sack from his back-
                       pack. Spock reaches into the sack and takes out a 
                       marshmallow which he attaches ot the end of a pointed 
                       stick.

                       holds the marshmallow over the fire.

                                 myself with the customs of "camping 
                                 out." The evening meal is tradition-
                                 ally followed by the toasting of 
                                 marsh melons.
    
                       Spock offers sticks and marshmallows to Kirk and McCoy

                       McCoy starts to sing. Kirk joins in. Maybe it's the 
                       bourbon but the two of them sound pretty good.

                       They signal Spock that it's his turn to jump in but 
                       the Vulcan merely regards them quizzically. The

                       A NASA Pioneer probe tumbles through space. Ancient, 
                       forgotten, the device is flotsam. On it's side is a 
                       plaque showing image of two humans and simple mathe-
                       matical and scientific symbols. It comes past camera 
                       and out of this distortion, _a Klingon Bird of Prey_ 
                       _materializes_.

                       Doors seperate to admit KLAA, the Bird of Prey's 
                       swashbuckling young captain. He is met by VIXIS, his 
                       first officer, a statuesque Klingon female. It's 
                       clear she adores Klaa.
    
                                               VIXIS
                                 (Captain Klaa, we have a target in

                       Klaa's crew watches with excitement as their captain 
                       straps himself into his command chair which has been 
                       equipped with an elaborate gunner's rig allowing 
                       Klaa to do the shooting himself.

                       A periscope-like device swings into position in front 
                       of Klaa's flashing eyes.

                       The probe is a tiny traveling speck in the distance. 
                       Its course is erratic.

                       The probe tumbles through space as the Bird of Prey 
                       swoops down for the attack. Machine gun-like phasers 
                       are mounted on the Bird's wings. They come to life 
                       and swivel, blasting a flange off the front of the 
                       probe. A second blast destroys a fin on the rear of 
                       the craft. A third shot blows away the antennae. 
                       Klaa is toying with the target.

                       The crew cheers each hit. They admire their captain 
                       and his deadly skill. But Klaa seems dissatisfied. 
                       He hesitates finishing the probe off.
    
                                               KLAA

                       Klaa unstraps himself from the command chair and joins 
                       Vixis at a monitor screen. The fearsome face of A 
                       KLINGON COMMANDER fills the screen and starts barking 
                       Klingon over shots of Nimbus III and the Paradise 
                       outpost. It's clear the Bird of Prey is being ordered 
                       to Nimbus III. Klaa and Vixis are charged with 
                       excitement.

                       locks on to the shuttlecraft and slowly pulls her 
                       inside. It's a delicate maneuver. Even with wings re-
                       tracted, the Galileo clears the door with only a few

                       There's no one to greet them, just a few crewmen

                                 There was a young student... except-
                                 ionally gifted... possessing great 
                                 intelligence. It was assumed that 
                                 one day he would take his place 
                                 amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. 
                                 But he was a revolutionary.

                       Sulu spurs his horse and charges the spotlight as 
                       pebbles fired from the enemy's crude weapons whiz 
                       around them like angry hornets. He gallops toward the 
                       blinding light, raises his phaser and with an expert 
                       shot, blows it to bits. The street goes dark, lit now 
                       by neon and the flash of gunfire and phasers.

                       The soldiers on the walls and rooftops open fire with 
                       their crude weapons. The Enterprise crewmen fight back 
                       from strategic positions along the street, expertly 
                       picking off the enemy and using their transparent 
                       shields to repel the volley of pebbles.

                       Sybok turns and strides out of the room, his robes 
                       swirling around him.

                       A symphony of smoke and rapid gunfire.Dizzying action. 
                       Running figures. Stampeding horses.

                       He charges his horse in the direction of the saloon, 
                       clenching the reins with one hand and firing his 
                       phaser with the other. Enemy soldiers scatter in his 
                       wake.

                       The Vulcan dismounts. As he heads for the saloon AN 
                       ENEMY SOLDIER leaps from a balcony, landing squarely 
                       in the saddle of Spock's horse. Armed with a sword 
                       the Soldier urges the steed forward to trample Spock. 
                       As Spock turns in response, the Soldier rears the 
                       horse up on its hind legs. Hooves threaten to pummel 
                       Spock into hamburger.
    
                       Spock calmly reaches up and presses his fingers into 
                       the horses's neck, executing a Vulcan nerve pinch. 
                       The horse collapses at Spock's feet. The rider 
                       stumbles off, gapping at disbelief at the Vulcan. 
                       Spock arches an eyebrow at him. The rider turns and 
                       runs like hell.

                       He thunders up the steps of the saloon on horseback. 
                       Kirk swings down and stuns a soldier with a phaser 
                       blast.

                       Sybok's soldiers set up a multiple pipe weapon cranked 
                       like a Gatling gun. Like the other weapons it uses 
                       pebbles for bullets. One of them catches an Enterprise 
                       crewman in the leg. He goes down.

                       The doctor rushes to the wounded crewman who clutches 
                       his leg. McCoy drags him to safety and digs into his
                       kit.
    
                                                McCOY
                                 I haven't seen a wound like that since 
                                 med school. These people are savages.
    
                       McCoy passes an instrument over the wound that emits a 
                       healing ray and effects the pebble. The crewman flexes
                       his leg. All better. McCoy gives the pebble to the 
                       crewman.

                       Dark and empty. Phaser drawn, Kirk cautiously makes 
                       his way across the room when, with a sudden hiss, 
                       the Dancing Catwoman leaps over the bar and pounces 
                       on his back. As she claws at him, Kirk twirls her 
                       around in an "airplane spin" and throws her the 
                       length of the room. The Catwoman lands in the "pool" 
                       table, sending up waves of water that soak the walls.

                       Spock enters  and reacts  to the unconscious Catwoman 
                       as Kirk blasts open the door to the back room. 
                       Caithlin, Korrd and Talbot look up  in surprise. Kirk  
                       breathes a sigh of relief.

                       Spock appears at Kirk's side as Kirk signals for the 
                       Hostages to follow them.  But the hostages confound 
                       them by pointing three crude pistols at their heads.

                       The shuttlecraft has landed  and been captured. Sybok's
                       soldiers shout their victory from the gates and roof-
                       tops. Others swarm into the street.

                       Kirk and Spock are marched out of the saloon by the 
                       hostages. The rest of the Enterprise crew is herded 
                       together.

                       Sybok appears from behind the shuttlecraft to thund-
                       erous cheers. The soldiers shout his name.
    
                                               SYBOK
                                         (above their cheers)
                                 Well done, my friends. Well done.
    
                       As the cheers begin to die, Spock detaches himself 
                       from Kirk and McCoy. In Vulcan he calls to Sybok 
                       whose back is turned.
    
                                               SPOCK
                                 Qual es tu... Sybok?
    
                       Silence. Sybok cocks his head to one side. For the 
                       first time we see him vulnerable. He's afraid to 
                       turn and look. The voice... the question... It 
                       couldn't possibly be who he thinks it is. Or could 
                       it?

                                 Qual es tu?
    
                       Now Sybok knows he's not dreaming. He pivots and con-
                       fronts Spock across a distance of several yards. 
                       Soldiers move away, clearing a path between the two 
                       Vulcans.
    
                                               SYBOK
                                         (a choke of emotion)
                                 Spock...
    
                       J'onn reacts with amazement.
    
                                               SYBOK
                                         (continuing; as he
                                          rushes forward)
                                 Spock!
    
                       Sybok opens his arms to embrace his fellow Vulcan but 
                       Spock will have none of it. He raises his hand -- a 
                       stop sign. Sybok stops short, hurt and confused.
    
                       They regard each other. Spock is without emotion, all 
                       business. It dawns on Sybok that this is not out of 
                       character for Spock. Sybok smiles.
    
                                               SYBOK
                                 Still tight-assed...
    
                       It's clear Sybok is trying to force an emotional reac-
                       tion from Spock. But Spock refuses to fall into his 
                       trap.
    
                                               SYBOK
                                         (continuing)
                                 Spock, it's me. It's Sybok. You've 
                                 finally caught up with me. Isn't 
                                 there anything you want to say?
    
                                               SPOCK
                                 Yes.

                       Sybok is incredulous. There must be a hundred guns 
                       pointed at Spock's heart. Sybok can't help it. He 
                       chucles. The chuckle becomes a full rich laugh. The 
                       soldiers join in and soon their laughter is ringing 
                       through Paradise.
    
                                               SYBOK
                                 Why, Spock, you've developed a 
                                 sense of humor after all.

                                 I'm sorry, Spock, but I can't 
                                 surrender now. I'm not through

                                 to forego the tractor beam and fly 
                                 in manually.

                       Sybok looks at Kirk in amazement. Kirk smiles uneasily 
                       and indicates Sulu.

                       The shuttlecraft takes off with a tremendous kick. 
                       Like it was fired from a slingshot, the tiny craft 
                       closes the gap between itself and Enterprise at 
                       alarming speed. But the bay doors -- they haven't 
                       opened wide enough yet. Just when it looks like
                       Galileo will pulp itself on the fantail, she banks 
                       ninety degrees.

                       Galileo negotiates the narrow opening by coming on its 
                       side<. It skids down the runway, showering sparks all 
                       the way, unable to stop. To our surprise a cargo net 
                       pop up to keep it from crashing into the retaining wall.

                       As the shuttle rcoils against the net, passengers are 
                       thrown about like rag dolls. Lights blow out and 
                       instrument panels explode.

                       unconscious. Sybok and Kirk come to simultaneously. 
                       But before Kirk can act, Sybok snatches up a prim-
                       itive shooting weapon and aims it at him.

                       The Galileo's back hatch blows open, emitting a cloud 
                       of smoke along with Kirk and Sybok. As Sybok steps 
                       down behind him, Kirk whirls and grabs for the weapon. 
                       The two men struggle and tumble across the landing 
                       bay floor.

                       Kirk is no match for the Vulcan's superior strength 
                       but he fights with everything he's got. He manages to 
                       knock the weapon from Sybok's hand. It skitters 
                       across the floor and stops at the feet of Spock who 
                       has emerged from the shuttle.
    
                       Spock looks down at the weapon, then back to Kirk 
                       whom Sybok is rendering helpless with one hand. With 
                       his incredible strength, Sybok forces Kirk to the floor.

                       Spock obediently picks up the weapon like it was a 
                       distastful object. Kirk collapses on the floor, 
                       conscious but no longer able to fight. Sybok faces 
                       Spock.

                                 Spock, you can't stun me with that 
                                 weapon and I've always been 
                                 stronger than you. I'm afraid
                                 you'll have to kill me.
    
                       Spock raises the weapon as Sybok advances.

                       But Spock can't shoot. The emotional price is too great. 
                       He lowers the weapon in shame and defeat. Sybok takes 
                       it from him with a smile.

                       Sybok's soldiers emerge from the wreckage of the

                       helps him to his feet. Kirk, in pain and betrayed, 
                       glares at Spock who cannot meet his eyes.

                       Kirk, Spock and McCoy are shoved into a cell by J'onn. 
                       Phaser beam bars materialize to contain them. Kirk is

                                 Let me get this straight. You and 
                                 Sybok have the same father but 
                                 different mothers.
    
                                               SPOCK
                                 That is correct. Sybok's mother 
                                 was a Vulcan princess. After her 
                                 death, Sybok and I were raised as 
                                 brothers.

                                 matters of a personal nature. For

                                 He's sorry. Well, I guess that makes 
                                 everything all right, doesn't it?
    
                                               McCOY
                                 Quit it, Jim. Spock couldn't kill 
                                 his brother any more than he 
                                 could kill you. If you want to 
                                 punish him for what he's done, why 
                                 don't you throw him in the Brig?
    
                       Kirk's anger burns itself out.

                                 Consider the questions  of existence. 
                                 "Who am I?  Why am I here?  Does God 
                                 exist? These are the questionsd man 
                                 has asked ever since he first gazed 
                                 at the stars and dreamed. My Vulcan 
                                 ancestors  were  ruled  by  their 
                                 emotions. They felt with their hearts
                                 ... made love with their hearts... 
                                 and _believed_ with their 
                                 hearts. Above all else, they believed 
                                 in a place where these questions of 
                                 existence would be answered. Modern 
                                 dogma tells us this place is a 
                                 myth... a fantasy concocted by pagans.
                                         (emphatic)
                                 It is no fantasy! I tell you it

                       Kirk starts to climb the emergency ladder. McCoy 
                       reluctantly follows. Spock watches. Then, unnoticed, 
                       he slips away.

                       Kirk and McCoy look down. No Spock. Just then, a soft 
                       whooshing sound from _above_. They look up.

                       Spock descends wearing the levitation boots from

                       ladder and grabs on to Spock. They dip down a few

                       Kirk, Spock and McCoy start for the exit when they are 
                       startled by the appearance of Sybok, J'onn and several 
                       armed soldiers.
    
                                               SYBOK
                                  I trust your message was received?
    
                                               KIRK
                                  You can't expect us to stand by 
                                  while you take this ship into the 
                                  Great Barrier. It can't be done.
    
                                               SYBOK
                                  What you fear is the unknown. The 
                                  people of your planet once 
                                  believed their world to be flat... 
                                  but Columbus proved it was round. 
                                  They said the Sound Barrier 
                                  couldn't be broken... but it was 
                                  broken. They said Warp Speed
                                  couldn't be achieved... but it 
                                  was. The Great Barrier is the 
                                  ultimate expression of this
                                  universal fear... an extension 
                                  of personal fear.
                                         (a beat)
                                  Captain Kirk, I so much want your 
                                  understanding and respect. Are 
                                  you afraid to hear me out?
    
                                               KIRK
                                  I'm afraid of nothing.
    
                       Sybok turns to J'onn and the soldiers.
    
                                               SYBOK
                                  Wait outside.
    
                       J'onn and the soldiers reluctantly withdraw. Sybok 
                       indicates four chairs, arranged in a circle.
    
                                               SYBOK
                                         (continuing)
                                  I'm sure you have many questions. 
                                  Here, with the stars of the 
                                  galaxy for our backdrop, we
                                  shall seek the answers together.
    
                       The four men take their seats. The lighting becomes 
                       intimate. Sybok weaves his spell.

                       Scotty awakens to find Uhura holding him in her arms.
    
                                               UHURA 
                                         (soothing)
                                  Easy, Scotty. Your back with us.
    
                                               SCOTTY
                                         (testing her)
                                  Uhura. I had the strangest dream. I 
                                  dreamt a madman had taken over the 
                                  Enterprise.
    
                                               UHURA
                                  Dear Scotty, he isn't a madman.
    
                                               SCOTTY
                                         (realizing she's a
                                          convert)
                                  He's not?
    
                                               UHURA
                                  Sybok's put us in touch with feel-
                                  ings we've always been afraid to 
                                  express.
    
                       Uhura gives Scotty a loving look.
    
                                               SCOTTY
                                         (uncomfortable)
                                  I... er... have to get back to the 
                                  transporter.
    
                       Scotty slips out of her arms.
    
                                               UHURA
                                  But there's so much I want to tell 
                                  you.
    
                                               SCOTTY
                                  Maybe when I'm a wee bit stronger. 
                                  I dinna think I could take it in 
                                  my present condition.
                                         (under his breath)
                                  Or _yours_.
    
                       Scotty heads for the exit.
    
                                                                                CUT TO:

                       Beyond the windows, the swirling vastness of space. 
                       Kirk, Spock and McCoy and Sybok sits in a circle.

                                  that place will soon be a reality.

                                  The only reality I see is that I'm 
                                  a prisoner on my own ship. What is 
                                  this power you have to control the

                                  Sounds like brainwashing to me.
    
                       Sybok closes his eyes and concentrates deeply.

                                  Father?
    
                       The surrounding walls come alive with energy. What 
                       follows is theatrical in style as we enter a

                       He turns to find himself on a brilliantly white, sterile 
                       hospital room. A wasted figure reclines on a bed, an 
                       old man connected to a powerful  life support system. 
                       This is McCOY'S FATHER and we are somewhere in the past.
    
                                               FATHER

                       McCoy rushes to the bedside.
    
                                               McCOY
                                  I'm here, Dad. I'm with you.
    
                                               FATHER
                                  The pain... stop the pain...
    
                                               McCOY
                                  I've done everything I can do, Dad. 
                                  You've got to hang on.
    
                                               FATHER
                                  Can't stand the pain. Help me.
    
                       In the near background, Sybok watches with Kirk and 
                       Spock. They are entranced by what they're seeing.
    
                                               McCOY
                                  All my knowledge and I can't save 
                                  him.
    
                                               SYBOK
                                         (the voice of conscience)
                                  You've done all you can. The support 
                                  system will keep him alive.
    
                                               McCOY
                                         (flaring)
                                  You call this alive? Suspended be-
                                  tween life and death by a bridge of 
                                  pain?
    
                       Father whispers something. McCoy bends down and puts

                                  Release... me...
    
                       McCoy looks into his father's eyes. The old man's gaze 
                       travels to the support machinery. He wants McCoy to 
                       shut it off.

                                         (recoiling)
                                  I can't.
                                         (in agony)
                                  But how can I watch him suffer like 
                                  this?
    
                                               SYBOK

                                  _I'm his son_!
    
                       McCoy reaches his decision. He shuts off the machine. 
                       The father dies in his son's arms. Sybok appears at 
                       McCoy's side.

                                 Why did you do it?

                                               SYBOK
                                 But that wasn't the worst of it was 
                                 it?
    
                                               McCOY
                                 No.

                                 Share it.
    
                       McCoy hesitates, trembling. This is his darkest secret.
    
                                               McCOY
                                 Not long after... they found a cure. 
                                 A goddamn cure!

                                 have lived.

                                 You must release this pain.
    
                       McCoy weeps for several moments, then wipes the 
                       tears away. He looks up at Sybok's comforting smile 
                       and is filled with a deep sense of relief.
    
                                               SYBOK

                       They turn and find themselves beneath the hanging
                       stalagtites of a cave. Torchlight throws weird shadows 
                       on the walls. The shadows depict a woman in labor, 
                       attended by a Vulcan High Priestess. Ceremonial drums
                       pound a throbbing pulse. The woman lets out another
                       scream. It reverberates throughout the cavern.

                       Spock's mother, the young earthwoman AMANDA, lies on
                       a rough pallet, her legs spread beneath her robes, 
                       her distended stomach lifting. Her only attendent is
                       THE HIGH PRIESTESS who intones the Vulcan birthrights.
    
                       Spock watches.
    
                       A figure steps from the shadow. It is SAREK, Spock's
                       father. He observes his wife with typical detachment.
    
                       As the drums build in intensity, Amanda begins to 
                       deliver.

                       The birth takes place in shadow. Drums reach a climax
                       and stop. An infant cries. Amanda lifts the mewling
                       baby from between her legs.

                       tiny infant kicks and cries. Amanda reaches out for 
                       her child but the Priestess turns and presents the
                       crying baby to Sarek instead.

                       He takes the infant and lays it on Amanda's belly. 
                       Amanda beholds the child up close. As it thrashes 
                       against her, she see for the first time its tiny 
                       pointed ears.

                       From behind comes a faraway voice. The voice of 
                       young Sybok.

                       from a distance, a hood shadowing his features. It 
                       appears to be Sybok on the day he and Spock parted.

                                               SYBOK
                                  I've done nothing. This is who they 
                                  are, didn't you know that?
    
                       The question hits Kirk with force.

                                  Dammit, Bones, you're a doctor. You 
                                  know that pain and guilt can't be 
                                  taken away with the wave of a magic 
                                  wand. They're things we carry with 
                                  us -- the things that make us who 
                                  we are. If we lose them, we lose 
                                  ourselves. I don't want my pain 
                                  taken away. I _need_ my pain.
    
                       A tense silence broken by...
    
                                               UHURA'S VOICE
                                  Sybok, this is the Bridge. We are in 
                                  approach of the Great Barrier.
    
                       Sybok is filled with excitement, eager to go to the 
                       bridge.
    
                                               SYBOK
                                  Captain, I'm afraid you'll have to 
                                  remain here. Spock... Doctor... 
                                  come with me.
    
                       Sybok and McCoy start for the exit but stop when they 
                       realize that Spock is remaining with Kirk.
    
                                               SYBOK

                                  Spock?
    
                                               SPOCK
                                  I cannot go with you.

                                         (can't believe it)
                                  Why?
    
                                               SPOCK
                                  I stand with my captain.

                                  I don't understand...
    
                                               SPOCK
                                  You are my brother, but you do not 
                                  know me. I am not the outcast boy 
                                  you left behind. Since that time I 
                                  have found myself and my place in 
                                  the world... here... among these
                                  people... my shipmates. This ship 
                                  is my life.
    
                       McCoy reacts to this speech. After a moment, he takes 
                       his place with Kirk and Spock.
    
                                               McCOY
                                  I guess you'd better count me out, 
                                  too.

                       Beyond the great windows, space is changing, reflecting 
                       this unique part of the galaxy.
    
                       Sybok regards Kirk, Spock and McCoy with affection. 
                       This is only a temporary setback. He knows the 
                       ultimate win will be his.

                                  Then I'll see you on the other side.
    
                       Sybok heads for the exit. Doors whoosh open to reveal 
                       the guards outside.

                                  You know we'll never make it through 
                                  the Barrier.

                                  But if we do, will that convince you

                                  What vision?

                                  Given to me by God.
                                         (as the others react)
                                  He waits for us on the other side.

                                               SYBOK
                                  Am I? We'll see.
    
                       The fiery look in Sybok's eyes might be confidence, 
                       it might be madness. He turns and exits.

                       Enterprise is poised on the edge of the giant starcluster 
                       known as the Great Barrier. It is visibly stunning and 
                       equally dangerous. We see giant regions of star form-
                       ations as well as expanding blast waves from exploding 
                       stars. Beams of radiation from pulsars sweep the tiny 
                       and insignificant ship, bathing her in color.
    
                 189   INT. BRIDGE - ANGLE TO INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN                    189
    
                       Sybok is on the Bridge, Uhura, Chekov and Sulu are at 
                       their stations. Caithlin, Korrd and Talbot are also 
                       present. They and the rest of the crew are transfixed 
                       by the viewscreen, awed by the vista of a sky filled 
                       with thousands of stars, each a fiery orange.
    
                       But what really draws their attention is the black 
                       thundercloud looming directly ahead. Here starts the 
                       ring of gas and dust that enshrouds the center of 
                       the galaxy, hiding it from view. Behind this black 
                       veil lies a region that emits ten times more energy
                       than our sun. Through the chinks in the wall we see 
                       flashes of blue light -- hints of the fires blazing 
                       within.
    
                       The ship's monitor screens go blank.

                                  They say no ship can survive it.

                                  I say they're wrong. I say the danger 
                                  is an illusion.

                       And with that, the ship plows into the Barrier, straight 
                       into the dark clouds, disappearing from sight. We hold 
                       for a terrifying moment, wondering if we'll ever see 
                       Enterprise again.

                       Surprisingly, there is no turbulence, no buffeting. The
                       Enterprise travels through a fantastic passageway of 
                       light and color. Then, quite suddenly, the gas clouds 
                       part and the ship enters a region of incredible calm and 
                       serenity, like the clear space at the eye of a hurricane.

                       The crew experiences the euphoria of safe passage. A 
                       wave of joy washes over them.

                       Kirk, Spock and McCoy feel the rush of happiness. 
                       They gaze through the window at this incredible 
                       spacescape, unable to deny the sensation stirring 
                       within them. Sybok was right.

                       and peace. Our final destination.

                       Kirk, fascinated by the planet, moves to the antique 
                       ship's wheel. He absent-mindedly rests his hand on it. 
                       His eyes are drawn to the plaque attached to the 
                       spokes of the wheel. On it, the charter of the 
                       Enterprise has been set in bronze. Camera moves in on 
                       these words: TO GO WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.

                       to life.

                                  from the planet like nothing I've ever 
                                  seen.
    
                       On the viewscreen, the planet appears up close -- a 
                       celestial orb, cloaked by swirling white clouds.

                       The bridge doors whoosh open to reveal Kirk, Spock and 
                       McCoy. The others turn, fearful of what he'll say or 
                       do. A tense moment, then:

                                  around?

                                  Because you too, must know.
    
                       Kirk looks at the hopeful facts around him. He feels 
                       the excitement of being on the verge of a great 
                       frontier, perhaps the _greatest_ frontier.

                                  Then if we're going to do it...
                                         (with conviction)
                                  ... we'll do it by the book. Chekov

                                  determined what we're dealing with.
    
                       Kirk's eyes flash with excitement. To Sybok:
    
                                               KIRK
                                         (continuing; with 
                                          a smile)
                                  Well, don't just stand there. God's 
                                  a busy man.
    
                       Sybok happily joins them in the turbolift.
    
                                                                                CUT TO:

                       Bay doors open. Copernicus, the shuttle backup, 
                       emerges and drops from the mothership. Thrusters fire 
                       as it streaks toward the planet, disappearing into 
                       the swirling white clouds.

                       Spock pilots the craft. He, McCoy and Kirk have changed 
                       into Starfleet uniforms.

                       Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Sybok descend into the bowl of 
                       the crater. They reach the center and stop. They look 
                       at each other wondering. "Is this all there is?" 
                       Sybok tries to hide his disappointment. He looks 
                       around for a sign that isn't there, then, after a 
                       moment of deafening silence, he addresses their bleak 
                       surroundings.
    
                                               SYBOK
                                         (shouting; a trace of
                                          desperation)
                                  We have travelled far by starship...
    
                       Nothing. It looks like a bust. Sybok's voice chokes 
                       off and he lowers his head. Kirk and McCoy frown at 
                       each other. Kirk whips out his communicator to 
                       address the ship.

                       Spock goes to Sybok and puts a comforting hand on his 
                       brother's shoulder.

                       Spock's words are obscured by a rumble from within 
                       the earth. A shadow engulfs the amphitheater.

                       The ground comes to life beneath the feet of our 
                       heroes. The earth buckles and ripples as if nature 
                       herself were trying to break free. Without warning 
                       a pillar of sheer rock rips up through the surface 
                       and climbs skyward. Then another pillar shoots up, 
                       followed by another and another. They encircle the
                       amphitheater like giant fingers. We intercut Kirk, 
                       Spock, McCoy, and Sybok reacting to this dazzling 
                       display of power

                       Within this primative cathedral Kirk, Spock, McCoy and 
                       Sybok watch as the ground in front of them melts like 
                       molten lava. It swirls, creating a vortex. A rushing 
                       sound comes from the planet's core, growing closer. 
                       Something of incredible power is on its way to the 
                       surface.

                       A shaft of energy explodes out of the vortex. It shoots 
                       skyward like an erupting geyser, blinding our heroes 
                       with its beauty and raw power.

                       The energy shaft rises from the planet like a beacon 
                       light. Enterprise, just outside the shaft, is bathed 
                       in its reflection.

                       Sybok staggers back. Like Kirk, Spock and McCoy, he 
                       must shield his eyes from the intensity of the energy 
                       shaft.

                       It pulsates and throbs with life. A GOD-LIKE VOICE 
                       comes from within.

                       As if responding to McCoy's question, the energy shaft 
                       throbs. From the swirling dust within it, a living form 
                       begins to take shape. The shape is powerful, beautiful, 
                       enticing.
    
                       Sybok and the others watch in wonder. The wind it kicks 
                       up causes them to stagger back.

                       Within this maelstrom of power, the form of humanity 
                       begins to take shape. And it takes on many forms, each 
                       reminding us of the holy paintings that have depicted 
                       the All-Mighty through the ages.

                       unable to venture out of it.)
    
                       The Being turns his gaze to Sybok, Kirk, Spock and 
                       McCoy. He beams with pleasure. His eyes twinkle.

                       It does indeed. No one knows what to say. Sybok is vind-
                       icated, he can barely contain his ecstasy.

                                  Magnificent. You are the first to

                                  We sought only your infinite wisdom.

                                  With a starship!

                                  Ah. This starship... could it carry 
                                  my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
    
                                               SYBOK
                                  It could. Yes!

                                  Then I shall make use of this

                       Kirk politely raises a hand.

                                  I'm asking a question.
    
                       The Being once again regards Kirk. Kirk stands his 
                       ground.
    
                                               BEING

                       The smile leaves The Being's face. Thunder rumbles 
                       faintly in the distance, underscoring his displeasure.
    
                                               SYBOK
                                  He has his doubts...

                                  I seek proof.
    
                                               McCOY
                                  Jim, maybe you shouldn't ask him for 
                                  his I.D.

                       A bolt of energy shoots from the Being's eye and then
                       strikes Kirk full in the chest, knocking him to the
                       ground. Spock and McCoy look on in shock as Kirk, now
                       injured, tries to rise.

                       Sybok is confounded. He addresses The Being.
    
                                               SYBOK
                                  I don't understand. Why have you 
                                  done this to my friend?
    
                                                BEING
                                  He doubts me.
    
                       Spock takes it upon himself to step forward.
    
                                                SPOCK

                                  What does God need with a starship?
    
                       The Being's countenance turns dark. Another bolt shoots 
                       from his eye and heads for Spock. Crash! Spock is
                       knocked to the ground.

                       Caithlin and Talbot look at each other in horror.

                       The Being turns to McCoy.

                                  Do _you_ doubt me?
    
                       McCoy looks at The Being's handiwork -- his injured 
                       friends.
    
                                               McCOY
                                  I doubt any God who inflicts pain 
                                  for his own pleasure.
    
                       The Being is on the verge of zapping McCoy when Sybok
                       interrupts.
    
                                               SYBOK
                                  Stop! The God of Sha Ka Ree would 
                                  not do this!
    
                       By way of reply. The Being smiles a truely wicked smile 
                       and Sybok realizes to his horror that he's been tricked.

                                  An eternity I've been imprisoned in

                       Spock shouts to his brother.

                       Before our stunned eyes, _the being changes into Sybok_ 
                       _himself_ -- a dark sinister reflection of Sybok. This 
                       Evil Sybok laughs, enjoying the reaction.

                       body, clearly at battle with itself. The good Sybok 
                       tears himself loose. He dominates the struggle until 
                       the evil Sybok manages to rip through and fight back.

                       tearing apart.

                                  Mister Spock, Klingon captain wishes 
                                  to name his terms.

                                  On screen.
    
                       Klaa appears on the viewscreen arms folded across his 
                       chest, seated triumphantly in his command chair. He 
                       speaks English the first time.
    
                                               KLAA
                                  This is Captain Klaa of the Klingon 
                                  Empire.  Attempts to raise shields 
                                  or arm weapons and I will destroy 
                                  you. You are alive for a single 
                                  reason. The renegade James T. Kirk!
                                  Hand him over and I will spare your 
                                  lives. My transporter stands ready 
                                  to beam him aboard.

                                  Captain Kirk is not among us.
    
                                               KLAA
                                  You lie!
    
                                               SPOCK
                                  I am a Vulcan. I cannot lie. Captain 
                                  Kirk is on the planet below.
    
                                               KLAA
                                  Then give me his co-ordinates!
    
                       Spock glimpses a possibility. He turns to Korrd and speaks 
                       with urgency.
    
                                               SPOCK
                                  General, I am in need of your assis-
                                  tance.
    
                                               KORRD
                                         (scoffing)
                                  _My_ assistance?
    
                                               SPOCK
                                  You are his superior officer.
    
                                               KORRD
                                  I can do nothing! I am a foolish old
                                  man.
    
                                               SPOCK
                                  Damn you, sir, you will try!
    
                       Korrd sees that  Spock will not take  no for an answer.
    
                                                                                CUT TO:

                       Kirk scrambles from one hiding place to another as the 
                       rock creature pursues him, able to anticipate his every 
                       move.
    
                 262   PINACLE                                                      262
    
                       With no where to go but up, Kirk scales a steep pinn-
                       acle. He climbs with agility and speed. He'd better. 
                       The pursuing creature is practically breathing fire 
                       up his ass.
    
                 263   WIDE ANGLE SHOT                                              263
    
                       Kirk clambers to the top of the pinnacle and finds 
                       himself trapped. He always knew he'd die alone. The 
                       rock creature climbs up to get Kirk, an inhuman voice 
                       issuing from its flaming mouth.
    
                                               CREATURE
                                  Give... me... the... ship.
    
                       A whooshing sound from overhead. Kirk looks up.
    
                 264   ANGLE - SKY ABOVE                                            264
    
                       The Bird of Prey drops out of the storm clouds. Its 
                       guns come to life and strafe the rock creature, 
                       driving it back, away from Kirk.
    
                 265   KIRK                                                         265
    
                       Vulnerable atop the pinnacle. The Bird of Prey hov- 
                       vers directly above him, its guns swivelling in his 
                       direction. Kirk is determined to go down fighting.
    
                                               KIRK
                                         (shouting in defiance)
                                  So it's me you want, you Klingon 
                                  bastards! Come and get me!
    
                       The Bird of Prey's transporter beam shimmers down and 
                       engulfs him. Kirk disappears in its sparkling light, 
                       saved from the rock creature who lets out an angry roar 
                       of defeat. The Bird of Prey takes off with its prize.
    
                 266   INT. BIRD OF PREY - TRANSPORTER ROOM                         266
    
                       Kirk materializes. He's immediately seized by two brutal-
                       looking Klingons. They march him out of the transporter 
                       room.
    
                 267   INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE                                   267
    
                       The bridge doors slide open and Kirk is brought in The 
                       Klingon crew regard him from their stations. Klaa is 
                       off to one side looking petulant. Korrd stands beside  
                       him, chest puffed up with pride, obviously in charge. 
                       Why isn't Klaa in his command chair? Because someone 
                       else is occupying it.
    
                       The command chair swivels around to reveal its 
                       occupant to be _Spock_. He unstraps himself from 
                       the gunner's rig, stands up and straightens his 
                       uniform in a dignified manner.
    
                                               SPOCK
                                  Welcome aboard, Captain.
    
                                               KORRD
                                         (to the guards)
                                  Release him.
    
                       The guards step away from Kirk. Klaa glares at Korrd 
                       but it's clear the older Klingon is now calling the 
                       shots.
    
                       Kirk regards the stoic Spock with affection and 
                       wonder.
    
                                               KIRK
                                         (can't believe it)
                                  Spock, I thought I was going to die.
    
                                               SPOCK
                                  Not possible. You were never alone.
    
                       Kirk fights back tears and clasps his friend in a hug. 
                       Spock stiffens with embarassment.
    
                                               SPOCK
                                  Please, Captain. Not in front of 
                                  the Klingons.
    
                       Kirk laughs and hugs him all the harder. Spock tentat-
                       ively hugs him back.
    
                                                                                CUT TO:

                       A reception is in full swing. Spock and McCoy are dis-
                       covered off by themselves, standing at the observation 
                       window, gazing out at the God planet.

                                  to you that the Great Barrier wasn't 
                                  placed there to keep us out -- but 
                                  to keep that thing in?

                       The Klingon polishes off a tumbler of fluid. He frowns. 
                       What he wants is a real drink. Scotty approaches him.
    
                                               SCOTTY
                                  Would you care  for a wee nip of 
                                  scotch whisky?
    
                                               KORRD
                                  Umm...
    
                       Scotty produces a bottle and pours a splash into the 
                       Klingon's tumbler. Korrd downs it with obvious 
                       relish. Scotty smiles.
    
                                               SCOTTY
                                  I never thought I'd be drinking with 
                                  a Klingon.
    
                       Korrd chortles agreeably and moves off. We follow him 
                       over to Talbot and Caithlin.

                                  And what are you two conspiring

                       He's been watching with satisfaction. As he turns, he 
                       notices Klaa eyeing him keenly from across the room -- 
                       the young gun locking eyes with the seasoned pro. With 
                       a smile, Kirk gives Klaa the Klingon salute.
    
                       Kirk notices Spock and McCoy still standing at the 
                       window, still staring out, oblivious to the party 
                       around them. Kirk approaches.

                                  ... is God really out there?
    
                                               KIRK
                                  Maybe He's not out there, Bones. 
                                  Maybe He's right here... in 
                                  human heart.
                                         (noticing Spock's distant 
                                          expression)
                                  Spock?
    
                                               SPOCK
                                  I was thinking of Sybok.
    
                                               KIRK
                                  I lost a brother once. But I was 
                                  lucky; I got him back.
    
                                               McCOY
                                  I thought you said men like us 
                                  don't have families.
    
                                               KIRK
                                  I was wrong.
    
                       Camera pushes in on them and we slowly...
    
                       DISSOLVE TO:
    
                 271   EXT. YOSEMITE - NIGHT                                        271
    
                       Camera pulls back from a roaring campfire. McCoy pours 
                       two cupsful of bourbon and hands one to Kirk who sets 
                       aside his marshmallow on a stick. Kirk and McCoy clink 
                       cups in a silent toast and drink, distracted by strange 
                       plinking sounds from close by. Spock is revealed, 
                       absently strumming his Vulcan lute in search of a tune.
    
                                               KIRK
                                         (with a smile)
                                  Well, are you just going to sit 
                                  there and pick at it or are you 
                                  going to play something?
    
                       The plinks and plunks gradually become a tune. The un-
                       mistakable "Row Your Boat." Kirk and McCoy react with 
                       delight. McCoy takes a hit of bourbon and clears his 
                       throat.
    
                                               McCOY
                                         (singing)
                                  "Row, row, row your boat gently 
                                  down the stream..."
    
                       Kirk jumps in and, when it's his turn, Spock joins 
                       the chorus too. The three shipmates sing loudly 
                       with feeling and gusto. Their voices climb into the 
                       night sky.
    
                                               VOICES
                                  "... merrily, merrily, merrily, 
                                  merrily, life is but a dream..."
    
                       As they continue to sing, we execute the greatest pull
                       back of all time. The campfire becomes a dot of light. 
                       The dot of light joins other dots of light. They become 
                       the stars of the universe.
    
                       AND THE ADVENTURE CONTINUES
                          
                                               _THE END_
