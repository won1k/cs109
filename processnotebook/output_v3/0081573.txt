THE FOUR GREAT VILLAINS:

Three of these creatures are men: the fourth is a woman. She is tall and has a magnificent body which is shown to its best advantage in a Krypton outfit that reveals more than it conceals: high boots, a clinging body suit, and all shiny black. Long raven hair frames a strikingly beautiful face; her eyes are almost fiery in their grace. A woman whose beauty makes strong men weak, she is consumed by total hatred of the male sex. This is URSA.

One of the men, who struts and swaggers like the leader, is got up in a Kryptonian version of ultra-military attire - Jackboots, high collar, uniform. All this, however, is belied by his pasty-faced, even sickly appearance. A pathological dictator, as super-Fascist whose only quality is utter contempt for everyone but himself, whose only goal is to command a world of inferiors. This is GENERAL ZOD. 

The second man is a thin, wiry character whose face seems to be permanently contorted into a twisted, mocking grin. There is something seedy and second-rate about his appearance, even as his clothing is flashier, gaudier and, finally, more vulgar than the others. A psychopathic jokester, whose pranks and "practical jokes" are only funny to him when they cause death and suffering to others, this is JAK-EL.

The fourth member of the band is only a man to the extent that he is not an animal. A monstrous brute, his ugly face twists with violence. He does not speak but instead utters horrible animal-like growls and howls. Almost pure if, bent only on mindless destruction, he is a force of frightening evil. This is NON.

Non lets out a terrifying howl, like an animal who has burst its bonds.

PAN DOWN WITH him to:

287EXT. GARBAGE DUMP - OUTSKIRTS OF METROPOLIS - DAY

A site that instantly creates the biggest contrast with the mysterious beauty of outer space that we have just seen: a city garbage dump, dotted with reeking mounds of refuse and grey smoking bonfires. For it is here, in a place as close to deserted as can be found near the great city of  Metropolis, that Superman can land unobserved.  CLOSER ON HIM - FULL LENGTH: He lands, looking just a bit bushed from his recent  ordeal.

SUPERMAN 
Whew. . . 

He brushes himself off and walks OUT OF FRAME, RIGHT.

288EXT. SHACK - GARBAGE DUMP - DAY

FULL SHOT: ON a beat-up, dilapidated old shack on the edge of the dump. Superman  walks behind it from LEFT. For a moment he is blocked from OUR VIEW, as CAMERA HOLD IN PLACE. Then, emerging from RIGHT of shack, transformed into his familiar guise of Clark Kent: suit, tie, glasses, etc.

PAN with him as Clark turns onto the dirt road and begins walking jauntily toward  Metropolis.  In b. g. the skyscrapers and bridges if the city can be SEEN.

PULL BACK AND WIDEN TO INCLUDE Jimmy as Lois looks up and grins.

LOIS 
My mother thanks you, my father thanks you --

CLARK (O.S.)  
-- and Superman thanks you.

WIDEN MORE TO REVEAL Clark Kent who has Just come over to Join them.

CLARK 
(kidding) 
How much does he pay you for 
all the P.R.  stuff you write?

The mood between them, though light and chipper, is complicated. Lois is more "up" than  Clark, who seems to have a barely disguised, case of unrequited love. Odd, but true: the more  he does to make her head spin as Superman, the  less she appreciates good old Clark Kent.

LOIS 
Ahhh, the boy reporter. Late as usual.

CLARK         
(lightly) 
stuck in traffic.
(gestures toward the headline; 
a bit less airy) 
Not everyone can fly, you know.

LOIS
(not unpleased) 
Do I detect a note of jealousy?

CLARK        
(a bit miffed)
I know I can't compete with 
some body who  can fry an egg 
by winking at it.

FAVORING LOIS -- who smiles fondly at him. Jimmy silently slips away with utmost discretion.

289CONITINED (2)

LOIS 
Clark Kent, you are jealous. And it is very becoming. I'll tell you the truth - if I hadn't  had my girlish head turned by Superman, I'd  say you were a prize catch.

CLARK             
(very hopeful) 
Me?

LOIS 
Sure. You've got everything.

FAVORING CLARK - who smiles as. But the quickly fades as --

LOIS 
But nobody knows it. What good is everything if  you haven't got it together?
(pushing) 
Do you mind if I give you some constructive  criticism?

CLARK Yes.

LOIS            
(goes right on) You could be a take-charge guy! All you need is a  little drive. Be aggressive. Push! Not just personally.  Professionally, too. All those chances to be a top  reporter are just waiting to be grabbed! I grab them.

CLARK God knows . . .

She rises, trying to get to him, shake him up.

LOIS You've had those chances, too! But where were  you?                             (ticking off a list with                growing impatience)  'Making a phone call.' 'In the washroom.' 'Stuck in  traffic.'  CONTINUED

CLARK A charming metaphor for my life. 'Stuck in traffic.'

LOIS Well? Weave in and out, Clark!

CLARK In and out.

LOIS          
(practically a             cheerleader now) Get up and go!

ZOOM PAST THEM to the frosted glass door leading to Editor Perry White's office as the  door is swung open and an excited Perry comes rushing out toward them.

PERRY           
(Just as Lois               finishes last line) You said it!

He dashes to them. MOVE IN TO TIGHT THREE SHOT.

PERRY  Something big is breaking!

LOIS A dinosaur egg?

PERRY             
(sarcastic as usual) Excuse me ma'am, I hate to interrupt my star reporters who are so busy sitting on their --

LOIS

289CONTINUED (4)

PERRY Yeah, well, move your laurels down to 73rd and Park. A gang of terrorists just seized some cockamamie U.S. delegation!

Instantly Lois grabs her notebook and starts the elevator; Clark Kent is right with her. As the hustle off:   PERRY Try and talk to them! Get an interview if you can!

ON THE ELEVATORS: One opens and they go in.

290INT. ELEVATOR

Indicator shows it is going down quickly.

LOIS                 
(a bit embarrassed) Well, that sure put an end to my pep talk.              
(changing the subject) I wonder which delegation --

CLARK            
(sincerely) Listen, thanks for that advice before. I mean it, Lois.

LOIS Oh. Well.             
(awkward now) I didn't mean to sound like a coach, Clark. But that's what friends are for.

CLARK                
(plaintively) 'Friends. . . '

The elevator stops; door opens. TRACKING OUT with them into --

291INT. LOBBY - "DAILY PLANET" -  DAY

LOIS I don't mean I only think of you as just a  friend, Clark.

They are out the door.

CUT TO 

292EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF "DAILY PLANET" BUILDING - DAY

ON them as they dash out into the street, wildly hailing a cab in the middle of a real city  traffic Jam: bumper-to bumper, HORNS blowing.

CLARK              
(still eagerly pursuing                       her last remark) You mean . . . ?

LOIS I mean . . . in a way . . . Look, this isn't the time or the place to --

Suddenly they turn to each other with a little conspiratorial grin and, speaking almost in  unison, hit the same realisation at the same moment: 

CLARK AND LOIS  Stuck in traffic . . . 

CUT TO 

293EXT. DELEGATION SKYSCRAPER - DAY

WIDE LONG SHOT: The main entrance of a tall, flat-roofed modern office building is  cordoned off and guarded by a great many heavily armed policemen. Police wagons and  vans and squad cars are parked all around, as well as mobile  TV units. A general buzz of heightened activity: walkie-talkies going, the area swarming with reporters and  photographers, the crowds pushed back behind barricades. In b. g. a taxi pulls up; Clark  and Lois jump out and run to join the crowd of reporters.

CONTINUED

293CONTINUED

CLOSER on the reporters who surge forward against the cordon, as a harried, tense POLICE SPOKESMAN emerges from the building.

ON SPOKESMAN

SPOKESMAN Awright, here's the situation . Three terrorists  have occupied the twenty-fifth floor. We don't  know who they are -- they claim it's the Freedom Guerilla Army. We're checking that out. They've  got hostages -- at least nine -- in an office up there.  They say they're going to kill one every hour until  their demands are met.

A REPORTER  What demands ?

SPOKESMAN At this point in time, we don't know that information. We established communication but we still don't  know what the fu . . . what they want.

ON CLARK -- busy taking notes. Only now does he slowly look up as he says to Lois:

CLARK Five'll get 'you ten it's --

WIDEN SHOT TO SEE what Clark sees: Lois is gone.

CLARK Lois!  CUT TO  294INT . DELEGATION SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - DAY

TRACKING -- She runs to the corridor where the elevators are. Frantically she presses the elevator button.

NEW ANGLE -- A POLICEMAN turns into the corridor and raises his gun. As he calls out, the elevator door opens. 

COP Hey, lady!

Lois leaps into the elevator. The Cop races the distance towards it. Just as he gets there, the  doors shut. The next elevator door then opens (as if they are programmed to work in  sequence) and the Policeman gets in.   FAST CUT TO

295INT. FRONT DOOR - LOBBY - DELEGATION BUILDING - DAY

Clark Kent comes tearing in, runs to the elevators.

NEW ANGLE: The Cop, in the elevator which has not yet left the ground floor, can't believe his eyes when he sees yet another civilian running loose.

COP      
(outraged) Hey, what is this, Grand Central Sta --

The elevator door shuts on him. Clark runs past. HOLD on the elevator, A moment later, it re-opens and the furious Cop comes out.

CUT TO

296INT. FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR - DAY

Clark pulls open a door marked "FIRE STAIRS." In this narrow, dinky space, he puts a foot  on the first step, looks up.

On the Cop's elevator. He leaps out, runs to the fire stairs, flings open the door. He looks up.

POV: VIEW AS BEFORE , but no Clark Kent to be seen .

CUT TO

298INT. DELEGATION OFFICE CORRIDOR - 25TH FLOOR - DAY

We are ON a glass-walled office in which a drama of our time is being played out. Three TERRORISTS hold guns on nine hostages, one of whom is an almost hysterical woman pleading with the Terrorist who guards her. The image, in silence, is really frightening.

PULL BACK TO SEE that the corridor leading to the office is lined with police snipers in  full regalia -- ammunition belts, battle vests, gas masks, rifles -- crouched in other office  doorways.

In the delegation office, the Head Terrorist raises his wrist, indicating his watch, then begins  waving his gun wildly at the hostages, yelling. As the hysterical woman begins to cry, we  HEAR the POLICE COMMANDER O.S. at the very end of the corridor:

POLICE COMMANDER (0. S .) And one!

The police snipers raise their guns in unison.

POLICE COMMANDER (0. S .) And two!

The rifles are aimed at the office door.

POLICE COMMANDER (O.S.) Fire!

The GUNS ARE FIRED in unison, hurtling tear gas canisters towards the office. The GLASS DOORS SHATTER and smoke instantly fills the office and begins to pour down the  corridor, as Terrorists and hostages scramble wildly out and down the corridor TOWARD  CAMERA. Three Men burst out of the tear-gas cloud first.

At this moment the elevator door opens and out steps Lois. The Men are virtually upon her  and she seizes the opportunity to ask the nearest one:

LOIS        
(eagerly) Excuse me, what was it like to be at the  mercy of ruthless, fanatical --

CONTINUED

298CONTINUED

The Man brings a gun up and holds it at her temple, smiling. Lois chose the wrong side to  ask.

LOIS          
(weakly) I guess I'll find out.

At which point the fire stairs door opposite opens and out steps Clark Kent to be greeted bythis sight and a gun at his head. As the three Terrorists shove Clark and Lois back into the fire stairs.

TERRORIST          
(a small mocking grin ) Oh, yes. We treat all our hostages the same.

CUT TO

299EXT. DELEGATION SKYSCRAPER ROOF - DAY 

AERIAL VIEW: The broad flat roof of the building, a fire station exit door at either end. A  police helicopter hovers above as Clark and Lois emerge from one of the doors and are  pushed by the Terrorists to the very edge of the roof. As this happens the chopper swings lower and a LOUDSPEAKER VOICE emanates from it:

HELICOPTER COP (V .O.)                       
(loudspeaker) Let them go.

TERRORIST TWO        
(shouting to the chopper) In a pig's eye, pig!

TERRORIST LEADER                                 
(shouting as he presses          gun to Lois' head) Come any closer, man, and you can watch these  folks die.

CLOSER -- A beat of silence in which Lois sways, terrified, on the ledge. Clark, a bit behind,  watches her, helpless and worried. Then:

HELICOPTER COP (V.O.)  We're ready to talk a deal.. 

CONTINUED

299CONTINUED

TERRORIST LEADER Talk!

 HELICOPTER COP (V.O.) Release your hostages and we will guarantee your  safe conduct. We can land the chopper on the roof.  We'll take you straight to JFK. We'll have a jet waiting  there.

TERRORIST THREE        
(shouting)  Yeah, for you to shoot out the tires! We watch television too, man!

 TERRORIST LEADER Get this! You can keep your jet! We want Superman!

CLOSEUP - CLARK KENT -- startled.

HELICOPTER COP (V.O.)                     
(stupefied) Superman?!!

ON the group on the roof.

TERRORIST TWO We want Superman to fly us to Algeria. Nobody  shoots out his tires, baby. And we are keeping  these hostages!

HELICOPTER COP (V.O.) How are we supposed to get Superman?

CLOSEUP - TERRORIST LEADER

TERRORIST LEADER      
(a sinister smile at Clark) That's not our problem, Jim.  CLOSEUP -  CLARK -- little do they know it's his problem. After a moment he speaks  quickly 

CLARK Actually, I can get Superman for you.  CONTINUED

299CONTINUED  (2)

CLOSEUP - LOIS -- astonished.

LOIS You. . . ?

The look turns to admiring dismay as she "realises" he's stalling.

TERRORIST LEADER         
(scornful) Yeah. He hangs out with you?

CLARK Sure. I've got his private number. I swear it.  I'll have him here in no time. I Just need to get  to a phone. Why would I lie about it? Just let  me get to a phone.

The Terrorists look at each other, then at their Leader. 

After a beat:

TERRORIST LEADER Okay. Okay. And they --

He gestures to Terrorist Two and Three.

TERRORIST LEADER  -- will be right behind you.           
(to his men) Take him down to the top floor. Must be a phone there.

NEW ANGLE - The two Terrorists lead Clark to the far fire door 
(not the one they came up  through), Terrorist Two treating them all to a little revolutionary rhetoric as they go:

TERRORIST TWO Anyone who has messed with our people,  prepare to die! Power to our brothers in struggle! Yeah! And death to the oppressor! Your blood  will run in the streets --

And as they exit through the door, WHIP PAN to Lois and the Terrorist Leader.

300INT. CORRIDOR - ONE FLIGHT BELOW - DAY

Clark and the Terrorist emerge from the stairs door, again leaving the door open, and into  corridor. A number of closed doors open off the corridor. TRACK WITH THEM as they walk down. A Terrorist opens one. It is a broom closet. He opens the next. It's an office. He  points into it, indicating a telephone' on a desk.

TERRORIST THREE  
There's your phone, man .

CLARK 
Right. Thanks. Now. . .       
(stalling, reaching in his jacket pocket)  
Where's that phone number?

TERRORIST TWO         
(instantly suspicious) 
Don't go for those pockets, High Pockets.

Terrorist Two nods to Terrorist Three, who does a fast patdown frisk of Clark. Clark now has  one Terrorist on either side, right up against him. MED. FULL SHOT.

TERRORIST THREE He's clean.

TERRORIST TWO      (indicates Clark can                   now search his pockets) Better have that number, Jim. Or we got your  number.

CONTINUED

300CONTINUED

As Clark speaks the following in a steady patter like a magician whose hand is going to be  quicker than the eye, he has one hand crossing his chest into his breast pocket and the other  hand delving in his Jacket pocket:

CLARK Should be here somewhere. Should be right here. But you know how it is . . . .sometimes when you change your suit you forget to change --

On the word "change" his elbows come up hard, smashing one Terrorist on each side.  smashing them simultaneously right in the chops and sending them flying. In that instant, he  leaps into the broom closet, slams the door behind him. The Terrorists are quickly on their  feet again, guns drawn. They FIRE through the broom closet door, RIDDLlNG it with  BULLETS .

301EXT. ROOF - DAY

302CONTINUED

The two Terrorists look at each other in total confusion. Instantly, Superman reaches out with  both hands and cracks their two heads together. They hit the floor, unconscious. Superman   steps across them and crosses to the fire stairs door. FOLLOW him. He leans against the  wall, waiting.

TERRORIST LEADER (O. S.)           (calling from the roof) Mustafa! Mustafa!?

TERRORIST LEADER          (grimly) Say your prayers, woman.

Lois, trying to be brave, takes a deep breath and looks down, getting instant vertigo. Quickly,  she shuts her eyes, swaying, almost falling.

304ANGLE DOWN -- SHOWING the long drop to the street. Crowd below.

305ON THEM -- As Lois waits for the bullet in CLOSEUP

TERRORIST LEADER (O.S.) Superman!

Lois' eyes fly Open wide. She is about to turn and look when the gun is pressed tightly to her head again.

TERRORIST LEADER (O. S )            (threateningly) Lady, move now and your movin' days are done.

Lois stands very still, very discreet, but a tiny smile of hope begins as she hears the familiar  voice:

SUPERMAN (O. S.)            (sternly)  You want to talk to me?

TERRORIST LEADER          (cocky) No man, I want to fly you.

ANGLE DOWN: THREE SHOT -- Lois is turned away between the Terrorist, who is using her as a shield, and Superman, who stands a few feet away on the ledge. SHOT INCLUDES  the vertigo-inducing drop.

SUPERMAN        (tersely) You're grounded, bubby.

He makes a quick move towards the Terrorist. But --

TERRORIST LEADER Uh-uh. She is.

And so saying, he hurls Lois off the edge and into space. Lois, briefly glimpsed, screams in  shock and horror as she falls. But to the amazement of the Terrorist (and the audience)  Superman is not distracted; he keeps right on coming and decks the Terrorist with one  terrific punch, knocking him cold on the roof!

ON LOIS -- still falling, shrieking now, the ground coming up fast. At the last moment, Superman swoops INTO FRAME, catching her in his arms as her last scream turns into a  moan of relief. She buries her face against his chest. He smoothes her skirt down and deposits her gently on the pavement:. Then be takes off immediately.

307IN B.G. REPORTERS and COPS race towards Lois. At the back or this crowd, pushing  his way through, is Clark Kent. As he reaches her with a look of great concern, she smiles at him mischievously.

308EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

OPEN ON CLOSEUP of a middle-aged BLACK CONVICT as he, in turn, opens his mouth and lets his mouth and lets forth with a rich basso version of the well-known Negro Spiritual "Let My People Go."

CAMERA IS ON THE CRANE, WHICH NOW BEGINS TO PULL BACK AND UP, WIDENING AND PANNING OVER the prison yard of a large penitentiary. From the opening Uncle Tom image, this looks like every prison movie ever made:  PAN REVEALS the prison-garbed CONS in classic situations -- one group playing ball, another group huddled around a card game, a third group sunning themselves, etc. Various entrances into the prison proper have signs over the doors reading "Print Shop," "Laundry," "Machine Shop," and so on.

As the song reaches its corny but stirring chorus, PAN CONTINUES to a dark, shadowed corner of the yard where TWO CONVICTS are deep in conversation, having deliberately isolated themselves from the rest of the prison population.

CRANE DESCENDS on these two, and we SEE that they are Lex Luthor and his assistant/architect/toady Albert. As song ends, we are into TIGHT TWO SHOT, FAVORING LUTHOR. 

CONTINUED

308CONTINUED

LUTHOR      (gnashing his teeth) If that road company Paul Robeson sings one more song, I'll put ground glass in his breakfast.       (to Albert) I mean, I've got enough problems, y'know? Y'know? I don't need a need on top of it,  y'know?

ALBERT       (ever helpful) I know.

LUTHOR What could you know? You've got a twenty- year sentence. A sissy sentence,

ALBERT But I'll be an old man!

LUTHOR You've always been an old man, Albert. A  fine architect, but not, not I say --       (God, how this         grates him) -- the greatest mind of our time -- of all  time! And how does the world choose it's  one true genius? Do they give me treasure? 

ALBERT No.

LUTHOR Who asked you?       (continuing his tirade) Do they give me glory? What, in fact, do  they give me?

ALBERT Life plus twenty-five years.      (tentatively) Well . . . if your plan to destroy the West Coast had worked, millions of people would have  been killed.

CONTINUED 308CONTINUED  (2)

LUTHOR 'Would' have. Would have, Albert. As it turned  out, thanks to the caped Concorde, not one  drop of blood was shed.

This seems to disappoint him a bit. As he turns away, miffed, somebody comes running from  the cellblock door towards them.

OTIS I just heard on the radio! Superman nabbed  a buncha radical freaks on some roof or  somethin'!

LUTHOR        (galled) That crummy flag waver. He'll do anything to get a hand!      (intensely) All I want out of life is to get out of here and destroy that miserable, glad-handing showboat.

ALBERT But how can you destroy him? You've tried everything. Nothing stops him.  LUTHOR          (slyly) Every man has a vulnerable point. I just didn't  find his in time.

ALBERT          (excited) And. now you've found it?

LUTHOR         (nastily) What are you going to say, Albert? 'A little late,  isn't it? ' 'Some timing, boss?'         (lowers voice) It Just so happens that it takes time, patience and  skill -- the Big 3 -- to build my black box.

308CONTINUED  (3)

OTIS That black box in your cell?

LUTHOR        (frantically quieting him) Shhhhhhhbh!

OTIS          (whispering) That black box in your cell? What's it for?

Luthor reaches into his pocket and pulls out a ratty,  shredded piece of Kleenex -- one that  has already seen its share of munching -- and pops his favorite snack into his mouth. 

LUTHOR           (to Otis) Get me a fresh supply of tissue, Otis. I've used  up my week's ration.

OTIS I gotta have somthin' to trade.

LUTHOR Give them Albert's radio.

Albert looks very unhappy.  LUTHOR        (back to business) So. All attempts to track Superman with conventional  means have failed including radar, correct? Correct.  He files at super-speed.       (confidentially) And yet we know that every so often, when he isn't  all tied up with --        (he says this like an insult) -- 'doing good' and taking bows and kissing babies --        (angrily) -- and posing for 'Newsweek' covers -- he goes North.  North . Where ? We don't know. The tracking device  always loses him.         (ruminating) Now why would he go North?

LUTHOR We've really got to break out of here, y'know. It's  beginning to affect everybody's mind.       (turns back to them) This device -- my black box -- which I have nearly  finished, goes beyond conventional radar.

OTIS        (weakly) I heard of. . . Alpha. . . watchacallems. . .

LUTHOR And you'll hear about them again, Otis. They will lead  me to his secret. And when I have that secret. I'll have Superman.

REACTIONS:  Albert and Otis suitably impressed now.

Everywhere is ice and snow; we are near the Fortress of Solitude.

Just as the Snowmobile reaches the top of a rise, Luthor eyes on the box, lets out a joyous  yelp.

LUTHOR Ah!

Albert, startled. stops the Snowmobile with a sickening jolt.

LUTHOR       (very excited) What have we her?

LUTHOR You can learn more about a man from the  contents of his garbage can than from all  his public announcements. Y'know?        (he pulls a Kleenex from his          pocket, pops it into his mouth) Yeahhhhh - there's nothing worse than an icy tissue.

EVE  I just thought it was pretty.

Luthor leaps from his seat with brisque, impatient gestures,  and strides to the shelves of memory crystals.

LUTHOR Quiet! Between your brain and your bladder,  a man can't hear himself think in here!

He puts the crystals back in their slots, takes another, suddenly turns and looks at the second shelf on the other wall. He goes to it.

LUTHOR  Maybe these are a little more . . . sophisticated.      (he takes the vary last one on        the shelf, starts back to "throne.") Hipper. More adult. X-rated . Anything as long as it's not --

JOR-EL That is a good question.

LUTHOR          (confused)  Huh? What question? I didn't ask --

JOR-EL You already know of Krypton's advanced  governmental system that enabled all the  peoples of our planet to live peacefully  and harmoniously.

Luthor makes a rude noise.

JOR-EL Unfortunately, even on Krypton there have appeared  -- once in a great while -- certain antisocial elements.

LUTHOR      (putting him on, razzing) How shocking!

JOR-EL  -- deviants whose upbringing or chemical balance  had gone awry. What we called 'malcontents' you  on Earth call them 'criminals.'

LARA . . . but he really needs his sleep now.

NEW ANGLE: The room, in which we now DISCOVER Non, Ursa, Jak-El, and Zod who is the commanding presence. They do not take Lara's hint, so she starts out, dropping the rattle back in its gift box on a table and carrying the baby past them. Non and Zod take no notice of  him; when he is held out politely to Ursa, she instinctively turns away with a grimace of  disgust; Jak-El makes a face he thinks will amuse a baby but just makes him cry.

But no,  Jor-El, we do not want you to vote for us.            (selling hard; intensely) We want you to join us. You are not appreciated by  the Council, but the people admire you. Together we  can sway them.             (pontificating) And when we are in power, all Kryptonians will serve  the state --

Then Jor-El speaks slowly, softly, as if considering --

JOR-EL Yes, General Zod, you have a point there. It's true, I  have had. my differences with the Council; they  didn't always accept my point of view. As for the way  I live --       (a wave around the room) -- I suppose it's simple. It is good enough for me. But  you're quite right.

JOR-EL The Council. of course, condemned them to a rehabilitation center.        (sorrowfully) But the usual techniques failed. Nothing we could do  would change their evil natures.

LUTHOR        (offended) Lex Luthor! Lex Luthor! What am I ? Chopped liver?

JOR-EL          (sadly). And so, because of them, I created the Phantom Zone. We  had, of course, no death penalty --

LUTHOR First good thing you've said, high-pockets.

JOR-EL  -- and our one prison could not hold them. The solution, as  I studied the problem, was a mathematical equation which I  developed and presented to the Council of Elders. The Phantom  Zone was constructed in space from this unbreakable, irreversible  equation. In it the four were imprisoned. A terrible solution, yes, a  cruel solution, but  one we were forced to make, Kal-El. There is  no mathematical equation that can free them.

LUTHOR           (pondering) Never?

JOR-EL We have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.

LUTHOR          (pleased) Hey! I asked the right question!

JOR-EL         (a trifle uneasily) No one, not even the scientists or Krypton, can predict  all eventualities throughout all eternity. The one danger  we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might, just  might -- we cannot know -- be cracked by a major nuclear  explosion in space.

EXTREMELY TIGHT CLOSEUP LEX LUTHOR -- He sits bolt upright, his eyes shining.

JOR-EL But our computers show this possibility as .000000002  in one million. Earthlings cannot travel this far in space,  nor would they ever have reason to cause such an explosion. So I think we can consider the Phantom Zone secure.

LUTHOR          (gleeful, singing)  'Gray skies are gonna clear up, put on a happy face. . . '

JOR -EL I cannot say I am glad you asked me that. Because we do not know  what could be done if they were  to escape.        (this is painful for him) I do not know. On Krypton, these villains were uncontrollable. On Earth, they would have the same powers as you do.

ON LUTHOR:  Extreme delight.

LUTHOR And he doesn't even know he did it! That's the  beauty part! That monogrammed megalomaniac doesn't even know they're on their way here or he'd be looking for them. Only I know!

EVE What do we need with friends? We've got you.

 CUT TO 355EXT. LOOKOUT POINT, NIAGARA FALLS - DAY

We are ON a small boy romping rather abandondly near a guardrail of iron bars as we HEAR:

MOTHER  (O.S.)     (impatiently) Freddy! Watch out!

As she appears and grabs him none too gently, PULL BACK TO SEE that we are AT the great Horseshoe Falls, in the large area where the public views the falls. The fence of parallel iron bars keeps the people from going over the edge. Every few yards, binocular machines that cost a quarter are set up in concrete bases, pointed at the great cataract. The area is filled with people: families and a lot of newlywed couples holding hands. People are looking, taking photographs with their Instamatics, etc. Not far away is a hot dog stand, doing a brisk business, and beyond that a parking lot filled with cars.

CLOSE ON THE FENCE AREA where, amidst the other tourists, Clark and Lois stand, both wearing shiny new wedding rings -- doing their newlywed number.

CLARK We should be holding hands. They're all holding hands.

POV: Almost every couple around them holds hands as they look at the falls:

CONTINUED

355CONTINUED  CLOSER ON CLARK AND LOIS

LOIS Afraid to let go, probably. When they let go,  they head for Reno.

CLARK Lois. I get the feeling all this -- being here, newlyweds  and all -- is somehow. . .           (cautiously venturing this) . . . threatening to you.

FAVORING LOIS -- This remark hits her where she lives, but she immediately throws up  her usual what-the-hell defense.

LOIS                   (mock Viennese accent) Zank you very much. Herr Doktor Freud. 

CLARK Okay. Hide from your feelings.

MOVE IN TO CLOSEUP CLARK who looks rather wistful.

CLARK But I'd rather be like them.

He stands looking at the honeymooners, when suddenly little PREDDY runs INTO FRAME, darting between and around Clark and Lois -- one of those kids who just can't keep still. This time it is his FATHER'S turn to retrieve Freddy and pull him back into the family group  (some uncles, aunts, grandma and the Mother). The Father wears a gray suit similar to  the one Clark wears. As he hauls the kid away:

FATHER          (annoyed) Freddy, didn't your mother tell you --

LOIS         (a bit uptight from the conversation)  I'm hungry.

CLARK  You're an amazing person.

CONTINUED

355CONTINUED  (2)

LOIS Aw, c'mon  -- anybody can get hungry.

CLARK No, I mean here you stand with one of nature's most  awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had  your back to it. Aren't you impressed? 

LOIS Once you've seen Superman in action, Niagara Falls  tends to leave you cold.

CLARK           (scowling)  Him again.

LOIS Sorry, Clark. I guess I a have a one-track mind. And  right now it's saying, 'Feed me.'

Clark looks in the direction of the parking lot.

CLARK Well, we passed a hot dog place back there. Will that do?

LOIS Around here that's a gourmet treat. I don't know how you  felt about Cupid's Special Aphrodisiac French Toast  Smothered in Venus and Adonis Syrup and St. Valentine's  Heart-Melting Oleomargarine, but I passed.

CLARK        (with a grin) Two hot dogs, comin' up.

He turns and goes.

ON FREDDY, now swinging very dangerously between 2 parallel iron bars of the guardrail.  All this is for someone's benefit as he calls out:

PREDDY      (big impish grin)  Hey, betcha can't do this!

CONTINUED

355CONTINUED  (3)

Suddenly, he loses his footing and almost goes over. His mother screams. But:

 A gray-sleeved arm shoots INITO FRAME , pulling him to safety. PAN UP the arm. TO  REVEAL that it's not papa but Clark.

CLARK Hey, Tarzan, this isn't the Jungle.

Mother now grabs Freddy away rather as if Clark were about to molest him.

TWO SHOT -- MOTHER AND FREDDY

MOTHER      (a hiss to Freddy) Freddy, didn't I tell you never to talk to strange men?

And with that, she deals him a resounding smack. As the kid howls, PAN TO LOIS watching all this about 10 feet away. She shakes her head. 

LOIS Right, kid. Don't get hurt. Let Mama hurt you.

356EXT. HOT DOG STAND, NIAGARA FALL.S - DAY

Clark approaches the stand and, with a little sigh, gets on the end of a very long line. As he waits patiently, bored:

CUT TO

357EXT. LOOKOUT POINT, NIAGARA FALLS - DAY

TWO SHOT -- Freddy again, dangling through the bars, doing bits for the benefit of Lois  who watches him with dismay. She is unwilling to alert Mama, who will only wallop him  again, but very nervous about the show she is getting. A high kick or two and a quick smile,  and then Freddy's hand slips. As his grin changes to terror and he plummets down the Falls,  we HEAR O.S. the Mother's piercing scream, terrified. He tumbles, arms splayed out,  clutching at air, and now there are other SCREAMS, pandemonium above, O.S. FOLLOW  the fall.

358NEW ANGLE

Suddenly a blue streak zooms out of the sky. It's Superman, swooping up the kid just before  he hits the rapids.

358ON LOIS: watching, thrilled.

LOIS                     (cheering)  Attaboy, Superman!

CROSSCUT: Niagara visitors clicking Instamatics and Polaroids, recording the SCENE; customers rushing from the hot dog stand in droves, deserting it to see the action; folks crowding the binocular machines, focusing them to catch.

360SUPERMAN, who is now flying up with the kid.

361Cheers and applause as Freddy is deposited before hysterical mother.

TWO SHOT: ON Superman as he delivers the child, safe and sound, to Mother.

FREDDY          (he loved it) Again!  Again!

SUPERMAN          (with a wink) Sorry, only one ride to a customer.

And off he soars to the click of cameras and more cheers.

362And off he flies, up, up, and away to the click of more cameras, more cheering.

363ON LOIS --  waving frantically to attract his attention.

LOIS Hey, wait! Superman, it's me. It's Lo--

Too late. He's gone. As Lois stands there dejectedly.

MOTHER (O.S.) Now you're gonna get it!

SOUND:  A loud SMACK. NEXT SOUND: A HOWLING CHILD.

Lois pays it little attention. Her mind more and more putting two and two together.

CONTINUED

363CONTINUED

LOIS        (miffed) Well! Hello and goodbye. What's his hurry? I mean, since he happens to be in Niagara Falls --       (that strikes her) Just happens to be here? Isn't that funny, Clark?                    (suddenly) Clark . . .                              (considering) And Clark isn't here . . .          (the light dawns) . . . as usual.  CUT TO

364EXT. BEHIND HOT DOG STAND, NIAGARA FALLS  - DAY

Now a deserted area, everyone having hurried off to see the action. Superman lands.  FOLLOW him as he moves towards the hot dog stand, (EFFECTS) transforming into  Clark Kent, complete with gray suit, glasses.

He is all alone with a tray of hot dogs, a tray of them, and finally -- with a little shrug -- he picks up two of them and starts back to the viewing area. He gets about four feet away and then the honest afterthought -- he steps back to the counter, fishes in his pocket, and leaves a dollar laying there.  CUT TO

365EXT. LOOKOUT POINT,  NIAGARA FALLS - DAY

ON LOIS, the crowd behind and around her dispersing with some still excited murmuring. But she is intent only on her own conversation.

LOIS Where were you?

CLARK       (passes her a hot         dog; then defensively) I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?

CONTINUED

365CONTINUED  LOIS       (not giving an inch) I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman  comes around, you disappear.

CLARK                    (trying for casual)  Superman? Was he here?

LOIS And you weren't as usual. What do you say to that?

CLARK You've got mustard there, on the corner of your --

Lois wipes it off. She won't be talked out of this now.

BEGIN TO TRACK WITH them as they walk away from Lookout Point and along the  path that runs alongside the churning, rapid-ridden Niagara River.

LOIS  I never started to put it together before, Clark. And that's  funny because a good reporter isn't supposed to let anything  slip by her. But I get it now. I'm beginning to.

Clark looking more and more nervous the closer she gets to it.

CLARK         (trying to fake her out)  Lois, I don't have, as usual, the vaguest idea what --

LOIS C'mon, don't fake me out, Clark.          (pause) Or whoever you are.

CLARK Whoever, I         (acting annoyed) Look, why don't you just take a walk and clear your head and I'II meet you back at the motel.

In a huff, he turns and starts to walk away.

366NEW ANGLE --  Clark, in f.g., coming TOWARD CAMERA. Lois is behind him. She watches him walk a few steps and then drops the bombshell.

LOIS        (very quietly) You're Superman, aren't you? 

We can SEE his reaction, but she can't. Then he turns to her.

NEW ANGLE - MED TWO SHOT

CLARK       (playing "incredulous")  I'm . . . what???

LOIS Tall, broad shoulders, dark hair . . . Listen, I've got to  give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean,  if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --

CLARK        (tense) I'd better phone Perry. There must be a reporters' home for the mentally ill somewhere.

LOIS      (she won't be swayed) Go ahead. Cop out. Run away.

She turns and walks out onto the little bridge that crosses the churning rapids. Clark follows her looking quite anxious.

CUT TO:

367EXT. BRIDGE  - DAY

CLARK Lois, I'm not running --

LOIS Okay, okay.                 (adamant; she comes to a       halt in the middle of the bridge)          I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I  say I'm right. Impasse. So I'll make a little bet  on it?

CONTINUED

367CONTINUED

CLARK How do you expect to win a silly  --

TIGHT CLOSEUP LOIS -- She couldn't be more serious.

LOIS Because of what I'm betting.          (pause) My life.

CLARK What?

NEW ANGLE, FAVORING LOIS

LOIS You heard me. I'm so sure you're Superman, I'm  going to stake my life on it. If I'm right, you'll turn  into Superman -- you must tell me how you do that someday. is it under your suit --? And if I'm wrong --          (shrugs)  -- well, then you'll have one hell of a story.

CLARK       (laughing it off) You've got some imagination, Lois. For one brief  moment there, you practically had me convinced.

He starts to walk off the bridge. She doesn't budge.

CLARK I say 'practically' though, because no one is gullible   enough to --

ON LOIS -- A very strange grin on her determined face.

LOIS      (almost singing it) Bye- bye, baby.

And with that, she calmly climbs over the bridge rail and before the disbelieving eyes of  Clark Kent, jumps into the raging Niagara river.

368WIDE SHOT, ANGLE DOWN: Staying afloat in these rapids is much more difficult than Lois imagined. She is struggling. At the opposite side, pushed against the bank, is a large log and tree branch from a fallen tree that has been wedged against the shore. 

CLOSEUP CLARK

CLARK Lois!

ON LOIS -- in the water; panicked.

LOIS  Help!  Superman!

ON CLARK --  in a quandary.

CLARK Now what do I do?  He darts his eyes to:

POV:  The log in the water.

370CLOSEUP CLARK -- He sucks in air in a mighty inhale of super-breath.

371ON THE RIVER: EFFECTS -- The super-breath pulls the log from free from its mooring and takes it right to where Lois struggles.

CLARK  (O.S.)  Lois! Grab hold! Grab the log!

 Struggling against the strong current, she manages to get hold the branch.

372ON CLARK: Huffs and then puffs a mighty exhale of Super-Breath.

373EFFECTS: ( ON THE RIVER) the gust of air sends the log with Lois holding onto it  shooting across the river like a rocket, right up to the bank and dry land.

374NEW ANGLE -- As Clark comes running off the bridge clambers down the side of the bank  to help pull her to safety, a wet and bedraggled and frightened and miserable Lois manages to scamper to safety.

CLARK       (pulling her up) Here, grab hold . . . take it easy, I've got you.

CONTINUED

374CONTINUED

He pulls her up to dry land, back in the path. Lois looks as described above, all of which,  on her makes her look very appealing and sexy.

CLARK Are you all tight?

LOIS                   (stunned)  He . . . didn't . . . come . . .

CLARK             I told you it was a stupid thing to --

LOIS     (can't get over it) He didn't come. He was here. Just before. he could have saved me.

CLARK Are you convinced?

LOIS       (still lost in thought) What?         (realizing) Oh, that you're not Superman!         (with a shake of her head) Temporary insanity on my part, Clark.          (angry) That self-centered, no good --

CLARK         (pacifying her) You took a ridiculous chance. He's probably a long  way from here by now.

LOIS Good riddance.      (suddenly conscious        of her appearance) I've got to get out of these wet clothes. Oh, look at  my hair!

CONTINUED

374CONTINUED  (2)  CLARK We'd better drive back to the motel.          (he puts an arm around her) C'mon, you'll catch your death.

Holding her to him, they begin walking toward the lot. TRACK JUST AHEAD OF them, in  MEDIUM CLOSEUP TWO SHOT.

LOIS You're getting soaked.

CLARK That's okay, I don't want you to catch a chill.

She looks up at him gratefully.

LOIS I'm glad you're not Superman.

CLARK          (a smile) You are ?

LOIS  (very little-girlish under     his manly shoulder) I'm glad you're Clark Kent. All of a sudden Clark Kent is looking pretty good to me.

A he hugs her tighter to him, CAMERA STOPS TRACKING and TURNS 90 DEGREES TO  WATCH them walk away, growing smaller the further they get FROM CAMERA.

EVE What do you want with the world? You don't even  like the world.

LUTHOR The world, Miss Teschmacher, is a lot of real estate.

EVE Land, land, always land . . .

LUTHOR -- Which they'll develop for me! As soon as they get  rid of Superman and we take over, I'll put them to work.      (seeing it in his mind's eye;         wild with enthusiasm) A super construction crew! No, a destruction crew!  Leveling forests! Creating coastlines! They can move  mountains! Think of it, Albert! The things you can  build! Monuments to me! Hotels! Ski resorts! 'Luthorland!'

ALBERT         (caught up in the spirit, rhapsodically) A sports-palace . . .

CUT TO

376INT. BEDROOM, HONEYMOON SUITE, NIAGARA FALLS MOTEL - DAY

The bedroom is just as kitschy and over-decorated as you would expect. Heart-shaped bed,  etc. Lois Lane, wearing a bathrobe and with a towel knotted turban-style around her head  (having Just washed her hair) is seated at a dressing table, staring morosely at her reflection in the mirror. On the right side of the dressing table rests a curling iron, (plastic handle, metal "blades"), plugged into a wall socket.

As SCENE BEGINS, Lois takes the towel off her head and shakes her damp hair.  Now she  looks like a shaggy dog. She looks in the mirror again.

LOIS Ugh.

SOUND: A KNOCK at the DOOR that connects the bedroom to the rest of the suite.

LOIS Yes?

CLARK (O.S.)  Can I come in?

She starts to grab for the towel to cover her hair again, then figures why bother.

LOIS Oh, what the hell -- yes, sure, c'mon in, Clark.

CONTINUED

376CONTINUED  Clark enters. He's feeling very happy about the turn of events and the romantic encouragement Lois has at last given him. He smiles at her affectionately.

LOIS I know. I look like something the cat dragged in.

CLARK You look cute.

LOIS Well, I am cute, but not like this.                     (smiles warmly at him) Thanks, anyway. It's nice to know there are still some gentlemen left.

ON LOIS -- She takes the curling iron by its handle and flicks a drop of water from a nearby  bowl on the end to see if it is hot yet.

INSERT:  It sizzles, evaporates.

ON CLARK -- watching her, enjoying the moment.

CLARK I'm starting to really feel like a newlywed.

LOIS        (little grin) I guess the next thing is I watch you shaving in the  morning.

CLARK I guess I'd like that.

LOIS Oh, come on, I bet there've been plenty or girls who . . .       (begins to think about it) . . . well, a few anyway, who . . .

As she turns to look at him questioningly with the realisation that he may actually be a virgin, Clark quickly changes the subject.

CLARK Anyway, as soon as you're ready, we can look  into that Honeymooners Miniature Golf Tournament .

FAVORING LOIS, MED. SHOT, CLARK IN B.G. She puts the hair curling iron down on  the dressing table and crosses to the dresser.

LOIS                      ( scanning the top of the dresser) Bobby pins, bobby pins -- I know they're here  somewhere.

ON CLARK:  He looks at the dresser.

377EFFECTS: X-Ray Vision effect in his eyes.

POV:  The bobby pins are in the top drawer, under a scarf. 

378ON CLARK -- who, of course, says nothing about it.

CLARK Maybe you left them in your purse.

ON LOIS

LOIS At least I had the presence of mind not to jump in  with my purse.      (still hunting) God, what a maniac I must have looked like to you.  I'm really embarrassed about this, Clark. I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mention -- 

NEW ANGLE: Opening the drawer, she finds the bobby pins, puts a few in her hair, then  pulls out another section or hair to be curled.

CLARK  Of course not.  LOIS Thinking that you were him, when all the time  I didn't take the time to appreciate you for yourself --      (holds a hand out) Hand me that curling iron, would you?

ON CLARK -- who has been absorbed in what Lois was saying. He reaches out  automatically to the dressing table.

C)  CLARK -- Holding it in his hand. It is clear he feels no pain.

D)  CLOSEUP LOIS -- Her jaw drops as she stares in wonder.

E)  ON CLARK -- a terrible expression on his face. He realises that he has inadvertently        blown his cover after all that trouble he's taken till now. Foolishly he keeps holding the        hot curling iron. Then he slowly puts it doom.

F)  LOIS -- She walks slowly over to him and takes his hand, turns it over, looks into the       palm.

G)  INSERT:  His hand. It is completely unmarked by a burn.

LOIS                  (pure wonderment)  It's true. It's true.

CLARK Lois, I . . .

LOIS I was right.  You are Superman.

CLARK       (turning away abruptly) You're just being ridicu --

But he can't finish the sentence, as he turns his back on her in anguish and frustration.

Lois, a bit hesitantly, goes over to him, gently touches his back.

LOIS I'm . . . sorry?

Clark turns back to her, looking very serious, very upset.

CONTINUED

379CONTINUED CLARK You don't have anything to be sorry about.         (in despair) How could I?

LOIS Maybe you wanted to. Subconsciously.

CLARK Do you think so?

380MOVE IN CLOSER to them.

CLARK         (soberly)  We'd better talk.

LOIS I'm in love with you. You know that already. How  do you feel?

CLARK We'd better talk.

LOIS  I'm listening.

CLARK Not here. Perry'll be calling at six to find out  what's happening.

LOIS                   (a tender smile) What's happening. That's the understatement of the year.  Well . . . where do you want to. . . talk?

CLARK Now that you know me, I guess it doesn't matter. You ought to know it all.

LOIS  Must have been tough.

CLARK       (emotion starting to rise within him)  Yeah. Tough.

LOIS Well . . .?

CLARK  Let's go to my place.  LOIS Your place?

She looks down at herself in her bathrobe; a small warm smile beginning.

LOIS Maybe I should change.          (pause) Maybe you should, too.

Clark begins to Smile same smile, as they look into each other's eyes, for the first time acknowledging and enjoying their love and conspiracy. MOVE IN VERY TIGHT on them  and:

CUT TO

381EXT. SKY - DAY

LONG SHOT --  Superman flying through blue sky, Lois Lane cradled in his arms. The  SHOT has a magical, fairytale quality to it; it is every girl's dream come true. To be swept off  your feet by a knight in shining armor is one thing; to be swept off your feet and into the  clouds by a knight in a Classic cape is quite another.

CLOSER ON THEM AS THEY FLY -- She is a bit scared, holding him tight around the  neck, but she wouldn't miss a second of it.

SUPERMAN        (parodying a pilot) If you care to take a look left, you'll notice we  are passing over Nome, Alaska.

Lois looks down briefly, then looks quickly up at him again, wide-eyed, breathless, speechless, capable only of a small exultant laugh as she tightens her arms around his neck.

382EXT. FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE - DAY

FULL SHOT: Superman and Lois land at the door of the fortress. He sets her gently down on  her feet.

CLOSER -- Superman walks to the door and pushes it open. He then touches the "empty doorway" (the invisible force field) with his bare hand.

EFFECTS: It glows and then fades just as it did for Luthor's neutralizer. All this happens  quickly.

Superman steps through it, turns, to see Lois still standing outside, dazzled by everything.

SUPERMAN       (holds his arms open to her) You must be freezing.

LOIS      (softly) I must be. But I'm not.      (looking around) Your home. This is your home.

SUPERMAN Well, a fortress is not a home.                   (he takes her hand,                     leads her inside)  Not till now.

LOIS Not even a cleaning woman on Thursdays?

NEW ANGLE -- Lois turns, looking away from him for the first time and takes in the various  aspects of the incredible room.

LOIS What a photo-story this would make  for Sunday maga --

Superman pulls her back to him.

SUPERMAN        (warningly) Lois!

She turns into his arms, ending with her face pressed to his chest. MOVE IN TIGHT as he  raises her face to him , looks into her eyes. Suddenly, in a rush of emotion, they kiss. It is  their first kiss, and it is so good that most of the audience would settle for one like that in  their lives.

SUPERMAN      (softly) Lois . . . 

With one hand he strokes her hair as if it were the only wonder of the universe he hadn't  seen.

SUPERMAN          (lightly) So you want to see the place?

LOIS      (picking up the light tone) As another lady once said, whither thou goest . . .

383CONTINUED

He moves ahead of her, leading the way, and she tentatively reaches out and lightly caresses  his back, putting her hand under the cape. He stops, having felt this for just one beat, and his hand goes back to catch her, tightly and draws her alongside him. They are very much in  love.

LOIS       (looking up at him         very earnestly) All my life, all I ever cared about was --                   (gestures off) -- out there. And being snappy about it. Well --       (deep breath) -- I'm not very snappy tonight.         (she leans her cheek          against his arm) And. I don't think there's anything out there.

SUPERMAN I mean, there's a few things --

LOIS      (brightening) There's a souffl, is what there is.

He touches her neck as she bends to remove the rood from the storage unit.

SUPERMAN She cooks too! Hidden talents.

LOIS      (a touch daring)  And just wait till after dinner.      (quickly)  Now what do I need?       (looks around the room) Flowers!

SUPERMAN In the souffl?

LOIS        (laughs) On the table, silly. Maybe I shouldn't call you 'silly.'

SUPERMAN          (lovingly) You can call me anything.        (venturing a joke) As long as you don't call me late for dinner.       (pleased with himself)  Flowers, hmmm?

LOIS Well, they brighten a room, make it warm. Cozy.  Even a few daisies would do wonders for this place.

387EXT. STREET. PISA - ITALY

ON THE CORRUGATED AWNING OF A SOUVENIR STAND as two hands tool it up. As the interior is revealed, we SEE the contents of its shelves: rows and rows of cheap plastic  souvenir Leaning Towers of Pisa, all leaning identically; rows and row's of  picture postcards  with the same view. PULL BACK and WIDEN TO REVEAL the Italian Shopkeeper  admiring his stock as he gets ready for the day's tourists. CONTINUE TO WIDEN: Now we SEE in the distant b.g. the real Leaning Tower of Pisa, tilted at the same familiar angle as all these plastic replicas. As the man hums happily, ZOOM PAST him TO an approaching blue dot in the sky. Continue to HEAR the MAN SINGING O Sole Mio.

CUT TO 

388EXT. SKY ABOVE PISA - DAY

Superman is humming O Sole Mio as well -- flying blithely, love-struck through the sky, looking for gifts for Lois. But now he notices something that disturbs him.

SUPERMAN What the -- my God! That thing's going  to hurt somebody.

He abruptly changes course and starts a rapid descent.

SUPERMAN Must have been a minor earthquake or something.

389NEW ANGLE, WIDE, FULL SHOT: Approaching the top of the Leaning Tower, Superman  cradles his presents in one arm  and extending the other fully braces himself in mid-air and starts to push it upright.

SUPERMAN Here you go big fella. . .   CUT TO

390EXT. SOUVENIR STAND PISA - DAY

As in the opening SHOT: The shelves of the stand right, the owner standing there dusting them, the real Leaning Tower in b. g. But now, as he stops his dusting to take an automatic look at the source of his success, a remarkable thing is happening. Slowly, inch by inch,  Superman pushes it into an upright position. The Leaning Tower of Pisa isn't leaning  anymore; it's just another tower.

391The Italian entrepreneur looks, goes back to his work, then does an incredible double take.

SOUVENIR SELLER Mama Mia!!!

He clutches his heart melodramatically, looks up.

392POV: Superman flies over and waves down cheerily.

SUPERMAN Don't worry! It's fine now!

393ONTHE SOUVENIR SELLER: Hysterical, smashing his wares off the shelf, making vile  and obscene gestures at the retreating figure of Superman:

SOUVENIR SELLER Super-cretino! Stronzo!

CUT TO 394INT. KITCHEN AREA, FORTRESS 0F SOLITUDE - DAY

A shy Superman presents his flowers and Champaign to a beaming Lois.

LOIS This is so incredible I hesitate to ask a mundane question. But -- where's the stove?

SUPERMAN       (blankly) Stove? Who needs a stove?

LOIS Well I expected a lot of. . . new experiences tonight,  but I wasn't ready for --                   (gestures to it) -- raw souffl.

SUPERMAN Oh, that's no problem.

The souffl in its dish sits on a table. Superman turns to it.

395EFFECTS: Heat vision radiates from his eyes, beamed at the souffl. It rises almost instantly,  perfectly.

396ON LOIS -- watching in amazement.

397ON THE SOUFFLE -- It gets higher and higher .

398NEW ANGLE 

LOIS Stop!                 (as he does so) Never overcook a souffl. You'll learn.

CONTINUED

398CONTINUED

Grinning at her, Superman takes the champagne bottle and merely touches the cork with one finger. It flies out with a mighty POP, bubbly spilling over in classic style.

LOIS      (a sigh of happiness) It's so nice to have a man around the Fortress.

They walk out of kitchen area to dining area, she bearing the food, he the drink.

399EXT. DESOLATE PLAINS OF THE AUSTRALIAN OUTBACK - DAY

(But at this point, we don't know it is Australia. From the bleak, arid, deserted look of it, it might be the surface of another moon-like planet.) WIDE SHOT of this desolate patch of land, which is really just a large rock outcropping scattered with small pebbles. ANGLE  DOWN as suddenly, a booted foot comes INTO FRAME, kicking at a pebble. PAN UP: It is Ursa, looking very discontent.

URSA Let's get out of here.

WIDE SHOT -- The four in this barren region, against an empty sky. Zod sits on a boulder,  taking a soldier's rest. Non stands in place, twisting slightly, Psychotically, making small  restless noises. Jak-El and Ursa pace aimlessly, kicking rocks.

JAK-EL She's right. This planet is not a lot of laughs.

URSA No me. Nothing to . . . play with.

Non's Neanderthal growling is getting louder and more disquiet.

JAK-EL Even he's getting bored.

He kicks at something that makes a different Sound than a rock. He bends, picks it up.

ON IT: An empty Foster's beer can. But this means nothing to them -- it might be another  kind of rock. He tosses it away.

JAK-EL  Funny kind of rock.

CONTINUED

399CONTINUED

FOLLOW THE BEER CAN: It rolls to the edge of what we now realize for the first time is a  plateau. As it drops off the cliff, WIDEN AND PULL BACK TO REVEAL the setting and  an equally uninviting valley below.

ON THE FOUR:

ZOD Enough! There is nothing here for us. This planet  is not capable of supporting life forms.

The others rise as well and move in a line to the edge of the rocky plateau, ready to fly off.  But as they, so to speak, begin to rev up their motors, a kangaroo comes hopping across their  line of vision in f. g., about fifty feet in front of them. With a happy roar, Non bounds toward  it and decks it with one blow. As he lets out a triumphant howl:

URSA Nice for him. What do I do?

ZOD      (sharply; suddenly)  Quiet! Listen!

SOUND: The distant SOUND of a CAR MOTOR and an automobile HORN.

As they cock their ears in their discovery of Super-Hearing, BEGIN TO ZOOM PAST them  TO mountain in b.g. where we can just MAKE OUT a shimmering automobile shape, moving along steadily.

400INT. POLICE CAR - DAY

(NOTE: From here on, actors proficient in Australian regional dialect should feel free to alter  the dialogue a bit. But not much.)

Seated in the front seat of the car are TWO TERRITORIAL POLICE, men in their 30's and in local cop uniform. They are BILLY and BARRY.

BILLY      (talking on hand mike        to radio contact) Did they bring them two Aborigines in yet?

The RADIO VOICE is that of radio operator MAY.

MAY        (RADIO VOICE)  Drunk as a pair of wall-eyed wallabies. And Joe Harris says says he ain't gonna waste good gasoline  towin' in what's left of that pick-up truck of theirs.

BILLY Well, it only gets this bad once a year, May.

MAY         (RADIO VOICE)     (griping good naturedly) Whoever said Wamago had to have the territorial  sheep-shearing contest every year ought to be shot.

BARRY       (mischievously) Why, May, wasn't it your grandpa thought that up?

MAY         (RADIO VOICE)      (after a pause) So it was. . . and he was shot, come to think of it. 

BILLY        (chuckling) lO-4.

Clicks off, hangs up mike.

BARRY Don't see why the Territorial Patrol can't see fit to  send us extra help for this thing. How do they expect  two lone peace officers to handle that bunch of beer- soaked sheep herders?

BILLY Well, if it gets hairy like last year, we'll Just give a  holler and they'll send a few troopers in to help. 

CONTINUED

400CONTINUED  BARRY Help drink up the beer, you mean. I swear, Billy,  why is it 364 days a year you never see mor'n ten  new faces in Wamago and come the Sheep Shearin'  Tournament, every weirdo that can chop wool comes  out from under a rock or somethin'.

MAY      (RADIO VOIC~)  Billy? Your wife called in. Wants to know should  she hold your dinner.

BILLY       (taking mike up) Tell her that's more'n I been able to do since I  married her.

The two men laugh.

MAY She'll be glad of that.

BILLY      (clicking off) 10-4

BARRY I mean, it used to be a man knew every face in these  parts for --

Suddenly his eyes widen in astonishment at what he sees through windshield.

BARRY Holy! 

401POV: On the horizon, coming down the road, the Four Villains. They look truly bizarre as  always, in their outfits with the additions of astronaut accoutrements, not to mention Ursa's  mask and Jak-El's boots, etc.

402ON THE COPS 

BILLY Some out-of-town entries, looks like. Good Lord,  they're wores'n hippies! This is a wool-gatherin'  not a costume ball.

Non, fascinated by the whirling red dome light, comes closer, to examine it.

BARRY Jesus! How long's he been in the Outback? Since the Stone Age?

407CONTINUED

Non stares wonderingly, bemused at the light. Suddenly, with an animal-like gesture, he  reaches for it and wenches it off the roof. He stares at it, making odd noises, and then, as if it  were the natural thing to do, puts it on his head like a crown. Billy gets out of the car, pissed- off.

BILLY What the hell do you think you're doin'! You can't --

Non growls ominously at him. Billy shrinks back.

BILLY       (clearly unsettled) I'm callin' for help, Barry.

He starts to get back in the car, but General Zod stops him, grabbing him by his shirt front.

ZOD     (interested in Billy's badge) What is this symbol? Do you follow another leader?

With that, he yanks off the police badge, pins it on himself.

BARRY       (going for his gun) Okay, buddy, you all Just bought yourselves sixty days in the --

As both cops pull out their guns:

ZOD A weapon of some sort?

BILLY      (brave, but shaking) This gun has your name on it!

408FAVORING JAK-EL: SPECIAL EFFECTS. He turns on his HEAT-VISION. The ray melts the two gun barrels like so much rubber. 

409As the cops stare incredulously at the gun in their hands:

JAK-EL Slowest shot in the west.

ON THE COPS -- Amazed and frightened out of their wits.

 BARRY God!  ZOD     (correcting him) Zod.

BILLY                  (anxious to get away) Now look, boys -- and, uh, ma'am. . . we're not  lookin' to make trouble. . . I know how it is when  you've had a few too many         (stares uncomprehendingly) -- how in hell did he do that??

Jak-El, with elaborate charm and niceness, opens the car door.

JAK-EL Don't let us detain you, sirs. We just wanted. to make your  acquaintance. New in town and all that. You can go now.

BARRY But --

BILLY Don't argue. Barry, let's just get outta here.

They get in their car. Jak-El, with a bow, shuts the door. As the others stand watching, Billy  starts the motor.  Jak-El leans in the front window, seeming to be interested. IN CLOSE.

JAK-EL Very primitive. How does it work?

BILLY . . . Internal combustion. . . sir.

JAK-EL      (brightening) Ah! Internal combustion!

And with that he lifts one side of the car off the ground and heaves it. 410LONG SHOT. The car goes off the cliff on the side of the road, tumbling over and over,  smashing against outcrops of rock, finally stopping in a smashed heap at the bottom, upside down. A moment later it EXPLODES in a roar of fire.

JAK-EL (O.S.)  He must have meant external combustion!

411EXT.  MAIN STREET - AUSTRALIAN VILLAGE - DAY

On a crudely-lettered, hand-painted sign: "WELCOME TO WAMAGO." PULL BACK TO REVEAL that this is a banner hung over a doorway. AS PULL BACK CONTINUES a man comes racing through the doorway, half-flung, and lands in the dirt road before it. Now a WOMAN strides through the doorway, her large hands on her large hips.

WOMAN                      (shouting) And stay out!

But, a good.-natured sort, she shakes her head, laughing as the man runs off.

WOMAN Shame on you. Harry Hargitay!

CONTINUE SLOW PULL BACK, WIDENING TO REVEAL that she stands in the  doorway of Tim's Saloon. Aproned, blowsy, big and blonde, she is the barmaid who takes  no nonsense from the local toughs. Her strength and womanliness serve a double purpose:  she is the local midwife. This is RITA.

CONTINUE PULL BACK until the entire "MAIN STREET" is REVEALED. Tim's Saloon,  an old general store, a little garage-machine repair shop and a tiny post office with a tall radio  aerial on its roof all front on the dusty square of this remote outpost. Another banner is stretched over the post office: "WAMAGO ANNUAL SHEEP-SHEERING FESTIVAL."

A much larger crowd mills around than is usual in this town, i.e. about 50 folks now, by tonight's contest there might be 75. Among them, sheep-shearers, the great sharp shears hanging from their belts, cans of beer in every hand; herders, wives, kids, and one sad-faced. aborigine pushing a large broom to sweep away the accumulating debris, as well as an ice vendor and an elderly couple dressed for a really great event (of about 25 years ago), strolling the square in the shade of her parasol.

ON RITA, MOVING with her as she passes the store, waving to a lady examining a bolt of  cloth in the sunlight, and crosses to Johnny Greer's Auto And Machine Repairs -- a ramshackle  garage with one gas pump in front. Most of 35 year old. JOHNNY GREER is under an old car; his l5 year old son,  WILLIE, is passing him a wrench. Rita stops. MOVE IN.

411CONTINUED

RITA Is that Johnny Greer on the other end of those legs?   He slides out - grease begrimed, smiling up at Rita.

JOHNNY Rita, me girl, there is nothin' as excitin' to me as  the underside of a low slung chassis.

RITA        (bawdy flirting) It's the car you're speakin of, I presume?

JOHNNY                 (with a quick look at                   his son; sotto voce) Not around the boy, wouldya?

With a wink, he slides back under.

FOLLOWlNG as she moves on across the square with easy familiarity, calling out greetings to all and sundry. But her smile vanishes as she sees something.

HER POV: A cluster of 3 or 5 sheep-shearers and herders, rough and mean-looking. The largest and meanest of the lot, a bully named ALFIE, swigs down beer as Rita, O.S., mutters  to herself:  RITA (O.S.)         (worried) Alfie's here.

As she speaks, Alfie crushes the beer can in one fist, and drops it in the dirt just to the right of the aborigine who is passing, pushing his broom.

RITA (O.S.) . . . startin' earlier than usual. . . 

The aborigine, doggedly following his regular path, misses the beer can. Alfie shoves him  violently, knocking him to the ground.

RITA (O.S.)  . . . and meaner than usual.

411CONTINUED  (2)

As the aborigine gets up and scuttles off, Alfie roaring with laughter, there comes an O.S.  call:

PREGNANT WOMAN (O. S.) Hope I don't need you today, Rita.

PAN TO a YOUNG PREGNANT WOMAN waving at Rita.

ON RITA -- grinning back.

RITA Like I told all my ladies -- today I'm not deliverin',  only pourin'.

 Cheery again, Rita crosses to the clapboard post office. A formidable black Harley-Davison  motorcycle is parked in front. She opens a screen door and enters, calling:

RITA Yeah, well I had me a scare too. Alfie's back in town.  You radio Officer Billy and tell him not to take his time  gettin' here.

413INT. TIM'S SALOON - DAY

Dark and crowded and hardly elegant. Even before noon the action is in full swing on the big  day. Rita enters in b.g. and takes her place behind the bar to help Tim who is frantically  serving.

Some sheep-herders are singing, banging mugs. At the bar , one drunk is unaccountably and  terrifyingly cutting another's hair with his shears while two others double up with laughter.  At the largest table, in the center, the main activity is arm wrestling. Burly Alfie, his sleeve  rolled up to display a massive arm, is taking on all comers. We SEE him easily best a large tablemate, then chug-a-lug another beer down.

None of which accounts for the look on the loser's face as we DOLLY IN TO CLOSEUP.  His jaw drops as he stares at the door.

MAN Gor Blimey! Hey, Alfie!

Alfie turns too:

WHAT THEY SEE: General Zod, Non, Jak-El, and Ursa have just entered.

As all laugh, Alfie wiggles his fingers provocatively at Non.

ALFIE Wanna play, Cheetah?

Non charges forward, but suddenly, before he can get there, Ursa is there, sitting across from  Alfie, elbow on the table, hand open, ready to arm wrestle. With a snort and a laugh, Alfie takes her hand. The fists clench together. Instantly she flicks his arm down. As she does so, there is a horrible SOUND of SOMETHING SNAPPING.

413CONTIUNED  (2)

Consternation. Alfie leaps up, his arm dangling, as Ursa smiles. He is screaming:

ALFIE  My arm! May arm!  She broke my arm!        (he can't believe it)  She broke my arm!

He stumbles out into the square, moaning with pain.

PAL TWO                   (leaps up, charging at them) Hey, you bloody bast--

Non seizes him immediately and in one easy move flings him through the glass window.  Instant pandemonium in the bar: people screaming, trampling each other to get out.

LOIS No. I guess the only question is --                    (it thrills her) What do I put on the mailbox, Mrs. Superman  or Mrs. Clark Kent?         (moving away) Why don't you think about that while I. . .          (not really kidding) . . . slip into something comfortable?

And off she goes. As she disappears, HOLD on him a beat, his smile fading, his face  suddenly troubled.

CUT TO

432INT . BEDROOM - FORTRESS - NIGHT

On Lois, happily opening her handbag, beginning to pull out something beautifully filmy, which she had the foresight to bring along. 

CUT TO 

433INT. MEMORY TAPE AREA  -  NIGHT

As a worried-looking SUPERMAN removes the last memory crystal from the first wall and inserts it. Contrary to his usual practice he remains standing  --  almost a bit defiantly  --  as Jor-El appears. 

               JOR-EL  Kal-El...my son... I have tried  to anticipate your every question.                      (disturbed) This is the one I hoped you would not ask.  Are you sure?

SUPERMAN             (with quiet passion) Father, I love her.

434INT. BEDROOM CORRIDOR - FORTRESS - NIGHT

Lois emerging from the bedroom, radiant in a beautiful peignoir, definitely a women ready for a night of love. But as she starts down the hall she is startled to hear:

434CONTINUED             JOR-EL (O.S.) If you have succumbed to this love of an earthling -

          SUPERMAN (O.S.) It isn't succumbed, it's --

TRACK with Lois, confused and curious, as she hurries toward the source of the voices, turning to an interior balcony.

435WIDE, LONG SHOT: The interior balcony, at the rear of the vast chamber, overlooks Superman and Jor-El below, some distance away. Here Lois stands, making no attempt to hide, as she observes this, to her amazing confrontation.

              JOR-EL --Then you are right to see that  such a feeling is incompatible with your life.                        SUPERMAN                                    (desperate) What can I do? May I never have her?

436QUICK CLOSEUP LOIS:  The glow gone, as dismayed as SUPERMAN.

437TWO-SHOT:  JOR-EL and SUPERMAN

438QUICK CLOSEUP LOIS:  in whom this news induces a mixture of amazement, anxiety, and wild hope for happiness  --  the last being strongest.

QUICK CLOSEUP SUPERMAN: on whose face we SEE the same conflicting emotions.

But before he can move or Lois speak --

439ON JOR-EL:  almost faded now, he suddenly clicks again and reappears, his face now  distressed, his voice full of uncharacteristic emotion.

JOR-EL Kal-El , think. No one can harm you now. But, if you do this, you can be harmed. 

CONTINUED

439CONTINUED

            SUPERMAN          (startled; then readily,                   almost lightly) I'll take my chances.

               JOR-EL And the planet that has nurtured you - its people who have shown you kindness, respect, admiration - will they take their chances?

QUICK CLOSEUP SUPERMAN  --  confused and guilty in the face of this moral indignation.

WIDE SHOT:  the whole area including LOIS on balcony as JOR-EL continues.

JOR-EL                (relentlessly)  Is this how you would repay their  admiration? Is this the example you would set them - to abandon the weak the defenseless, the needy for the sake of one's own selfish pursuits?

           SUPERMAN                  (stung) Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness - 

             JOR-EL                    (cutting him off implacably) Yours is a higher happiness. The  happiness of your mission.                  (persuasively) the happiness -- pure and quiet -- that you feel inside every time you safe a life, every time you inspire others to seek the best in themselves.                 (quietly) My son, you cannot deny that feeling.

ON SUPERMAN: nodding slowly. Under the burden of this argument he sinks into a  sitting position on a nearby platform, looking up now at his father.

439CONTINUED  (2)

TWO SHOT: Superman looking up at Jor-El.

             JOR-EL Kal-El, you cannot so quickly have forgotten my teachings - 

           SUPERMAN                       (looks up, defensively) I've forgotten nothing -

JOR-EL Then you recall what was said by one of the greatest writers of your planet; 'And this above all, to think own self be true. And it shall follow as night the day-'

As he is saying these last lines, Superman rises abruptly and turns away from his father. He is  now facing Lois/balcony but he doesn't look up. Staring straight ahead in despair he finishes the line.

SUPERMAN '...thou can't not then be  false to any man...'

           JOR-EL                   (quietly) I leave you with that thought,  my son.

A CLICK and he disappears.  

440TWO SHOT: A beat of silence as Superman stands still, looking at nothing. Unbeknownst, on the balcony above, Lois is in the same position, staring out unhappily over his head. She begins to speak quietly, almost to herself. 

LOIS Funny, isn't it? Here I am --

As he turns, looking up and behind him:

NEW ANGLE, LONG: Reminding us of a very famous balcony scene in the positions.

SUPERMAN                     (looking up, startled) Lois!

LOIS Superman.       (she leans on the balcony,           bitterly ironic) Wherefore art thou, Superman? Deny thy father. . .        (a sad smile) No, maybe father knows best. That was  your  father. . . ?

SUPERMAN            (awkwardly)  Yes, well, he was just -- We talk. I mean, we can  communicate through. . .  crystals.          (he gestures to wall with            first shelf of memory crystals )  Everything I know is in there.            (gestures at wall with             second shelf of unplayed crystals) What I still don't know is there.

LOIS You haven't listened to those?

SUPERMAN Not yet. I haven't needed to know what they tell.

LOIS          (bitterly) Maybe they've got some advice for the lovelorn.  For instance, Lois Lane, the girl who always got  what she goes after. Ever since I was a little girl.  You name it: straight A's, editor of the school  yearbook, a Job on a newspaper, bylines, top salary.  Once I set my sights on something. . .  Well, I guess  I set my sights too high this time.

SUPERMAN                     (deeply moved, he starts up                        the ramp towards her) No, you didn't!

CLOSEUP LOIS

LOIS No, I didn't, did I? No man was good enough  until somebody just. . .        (a sad smile) . . . fell from the blue. Impossible. Sure, for other people,  the kid who always gets what she --

Her voice chokes; she turns her head away.

REVERSE: He is there, beside her.

SUPERMAN           (reaching out) Lois --

TWO SHOT: She pulls away, trying to control herself, moving swiftly down the corridor,  saying:

LOIS I'm okay, I'll be okay.

She is stopped at the end of the corridor by large glass doors leading onto the exterior balcony. As he approaches, she turns suddenly to face him. Behind the star-crossed  lovers is  the starry arctic sky; the icy landscape gleams in moonlight.

LOIS        (bravely) But I did do it, didn't I? I did get the man I love  to love me?

SUPERMAN        (this is very hard on him) Yes.

CONTINUED

440CONTINUED  (3)

LOIS That's what's funny. I got everything I ever wanted. I even got the one thing nobody else could have.          (bitterly) And now I can't have it. Because everybody else  needs it. I understand, oh, how I understand. I tried  awfully hard not to understand, but I'm not that selfish. They need  you          (quickly) Not more than I do. Nobody needs you more than I do.         (soberly) But I'd be buying my personal little rainbow at the cost  of all those people. The ones who say,  'Help. Come. Quick. Now.' While I'd be saying, 'Stay. Be with me. Don't go. Stay home.' And pretty soon, it'd be a toss-up whether you hated me more or I hated --

ON SUPERMAN -- He finds her thoroughly admirable, especially now.

 CLOSEUP- LOIS

LOIS I was going to say, 'Whether you hated me more or I hated me more.' Because that would happen sooner or later.       (desperately) I'd hate myself, Superman.        (getting hold of herself) No, when you get down to the bottom line, I've got to live with Lois Lane. Alone or not. And I've Got to like her. You  don't know how much, right now, I want to say,  'who cares about your great. . .' mission, isn't that what he called it? But I'm not a bitch. Not that much of a --         (it overwhelms her;           she begins to weep) I'll be all right.         (a fake laugh) Just some schoolgirl tears.         (wipes her eyes; gets           herself together) Listen, I'm tired, okay? I Just want to go somewhere and -- and lay down.

CONTINUED

440CONTINUED  (4)

Superman is terribly touched and upset by her love for him and her sacrifice. Slowly he  moves a few feet down the corridor and opens the bedroom door she emerged from earlier.

SUPERMAN                   (awkward) Here. The. . . bedroom.

LOIS                  (trying a smile) I know. I've been thinking about it all day.     (as she approaches)  But not like this.      (at the door; next to        him, a deep breath) Well. . .

TIGHT TWO SHOT: Suddenly he moves to take her in his arms.

LOIS No.       (about to cry; she moves         away and pushes the        door open) No, let's not. . . start anything we can't --

She breaks off, pushes quickly past him into the bedroom and closes the door behind her.

HOLD ON SUPERMAN -- extremely upset, grieved. He turns and walks AWAY FROM  CAMERA, shoulders stooped. Then he stops and looks back in the direction of the bedroom.

441EFFECTS: X-RAY VISION

442HIS POV (WITH X-RAY Vision):  Lois has thrown herself on the bed and is crying into the  pillow, her body wracked with sobs.

443CLOSEUP - SUPERMAN -- he can't take it anymore.

SUPERMAN I love her. I don't want to lose her.  Suddenly, with the look of a man who has just made up his mind, he turns and rushes down the corridor.

SUPERMAN I won't lose her!

With  a look of determination and purpose, Superman strides to the molecular restructuring  chamber and enters it.

CUT TO

444CUT TO INT.  MOLECULAR RESTRUCTURING CHAMBER - NIGHT

The heavy door automatically closes. Superman goes to the crystal panel-bank and passes his  hand across certain crystals (or pushes a button, or whatever the activating technique is) and then lays himself down on the transparent, forbidding slab. He closes his eyes.

EFFECTS: The very specific light changes begin, employing certain key colors, laser effects.  Moving spotlights in a recognisable order and pattern -- all of it quite spectacular -- denoting the machine working. As the process continues:

DISSOLVE TO

445EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - WAMAGO, AUSTRALIA - DAY

WIDE: All hell has broken loose. The General Store has been demolished, felled. A number of bodies are strewn about. The town banner hangs limply torn. Three or four escaped sheep  roam through the devastation. A lot has happened since we've been away. One small knot of sheepherders -- diehards, resistance fighters -- is in the surreptitious huddle. Non stands by  what is left of the General Store: Jak-El is now in front of Johnny Greer' s garage by the gas pump; Ursa stands with General Zod, who, as we JOIN them, is in the middle of another  speech.

ZOD       (menacingly persuasive) . . . and so you see, we will have your . . .  cooperation. . .

CONTINUED

445CONTINUED

ON THE SHEEP-SHEARER HUDDLE: As they guardedly unchain their shear's from their  belts. TRACK QUICKLY with the four as they make a rush at Jak-El, shears raised. They all  fall on him, stabbing wildly.

INSERT: The shears' blades break and snap off against Jak-E.

WIDER: The assassins fall back, astonished, Jak-El grabs the handle of the gas pump, presses the trigger: gas gushes out as he turns toward Zod, with a wide grin.

JAK-EL Hey! Did you catch that? They think they're  hot stuff!

446And he blows on the gas gushing out of the hose. EFFECTS: HEAT-VISION causes a blowtorch effect, The shooting flames ignite the four sheep-herders; who flame up like tinder. Even as they do, the gushing gas spreads the fire and ignites Greer's Garage.

447ON THE POST OFFICE: May rushes out, dressed in jodphurs, furious, uncowed, brandishing a fist at General Zod.

MAY Hooligans! Break my radio, will ya!

She leaps on the motorcycle; steps down, gunning it.

MAY I'll get someone to fix your wagon!

And she zooms off from the standing start, an old lady daredevil taking off for (in b.g.) the  rise of the nearest hill. It is a comic image for a moment -- an Evel Knievel parody -- until:

ON ZOD -- watching her.

ZOD  We fix the wagons around here.  He nods to Non.

448ON NON: SPECIAL EFFECTS :  A COLD RAY FROM HIS EYES. THIS IS ICE-  VISION.

ANGLE UP to May: Traveling at breakneck speed toward the top of the hill, about to make a  turn as the ice vision hits. The handlebars freeze and lock; so do the pedals. A look of panic  on May's face; an instant later she is hurled from the bike, spinning through the air, falling  over the crest of the hill.

449ON NON AND ZOD -- Zod gives his ward an appreciative nod; Non looks pleased and  proud -- an evil child. Suddenly they hear something:

 SOUND: the noisy, CHUGGING MOTOR of a small, ancient AIRPLANE. 

450ANGLE UP: Approaching overhead, Doc Randall's plane, with 'Flying Doctor" painted  proudly on its fuselage.

451ANGLE DOWN on THE CROWD: Looking up at the plane with great hope, as if seeing  their savior. An audible sigh of relief.

452ON THE PLANE, NEAR CCCKPIT: Doc Randall stares down in disbelief.

DOC     (on his radio) May I Come in, May I What the bloody hell is going on? May? Where are you, May?

453DOC'S POV - THE FOUR, below, suddenly fly up toward the plane.

454NEW ANGLE: ON THE PLANE -- They arrive, placing themselves along the plane fore to aft. Together they tip the plane with a light toss. It falls, wobbling wildly just outside the square. FOLLOW its descent as it spirals down out of control, the engines now smoking from the interference. GROANS from the crowd.

JAK-EL Geronimo!

The Plane crashes, smoke spiraling, and EXPLODES.

455ON THE SQUARE - FAVORING ZOD IN FRONT OF TERRIFIED CROWD

ZOD                  (ranting) No Escape! No Escape! There is no escape! Are you sufficiently convinced?

MEDIUM FULL -- ON A SECTION OF THE CROWD where we NOTICE a BOY about 9  years old, on the edge of the crowd in front of Tim's Saloon. Pretending to be listening to  General Zod, he is in fact squirming backwards through the crush, never looking away from  Zod, but slipping towards the rear all the while.

ZOD (O.S.) You will remain here! We will remain here!  No one leaves Wamago alive!

By now, with careful backward strides, the Boy (we FOLLOW) breaks cut of the back of the  crowd. He darts around the back of the saloon. 456EXT. BEHIND THE SALOON - WAMAGO - DAY

As Zod rants on O.S., the Boy runs to an old grazing mare tethered behind the saloon. In one  jump he is on her back, loosing her rope, clinging to her neck, ready for the wild, bareback  ride.

BOY                     (whispering prayerfully)  Go! Go, Betsey!

Nothing. For one agonised second it seems as if the old horse does not even comprehend the command.

BOY          (despairing)  Oh, Betsey -- PLEASE!

Then, with a toss of her head, the mare catches on and, with the Boy clinging  for dear life, gallops off toward the horizon and toward help.

CLARK           (not looking at her either) Look, the world got along without Superman for a  lot of years --           (getting it together; perhaps              more cheerful than he fee1s) -- but the Planet can't get along without Clark Kent.

LOIS        (uncomprehending)  The planet...?

CLARK The Daily Planet, lady, that's what it says on  our paychecks --         (pointedly) -- which I'm now going to need. And we can't exactly  get back to collect them by the same mode of  transportation that got us here.

LOIS         (realising it fully now) You're really not Superman anymore. . .

457CONTINUED

CLARK            (chipper)  That's what I keep trying to tell you, ma'am. So let's  get a move on.

He gives her a quick, husbandly peck on the cheek.

CLARK Now, where's my gray suit. . .?

458EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - WAMAGO, AUSTRAILIA - DAY

FULL SHOT: Ina filed beyond the square, the remains of two downed, wrecked Army fighter planes. REVERSE ZOOM, coming toward the square, past the bodies of dead soldiers, then past a group of tied-up, penned-in SOLDIERS, finally to one end of the square where four hanged and trussed-up bodies -- four of the toughest ranchers and herders we saw before -- are hung like carcasses.

CRANE SHOT BEGINS WITH A VERTICAL PAN DOWN from theses bodies which then PULLS BACK and OPENS VERY WIDE TO SHOW the village square: there is a long line of people -- the conquered, frightened survivors of the holocaust. Totally beaten and in thrall now, they look like people we used to see in those yearly ceremonies of subjects bringing booty to the Aga Khan on his birthday or conquered people laying up their store for a bandit thief. For indeed theses survivors of WAMAGO are lined up with their tithe, not gold and jewels in this case, but whatever meager possessions they could come up with: an old radio, some family heirlooms, watches, a clock, a feather boa, and of course five or six baby lambs cradled in the arms of their owners. PAN DOWN this line, SEEING these details, as well as the frightened, defeated faces. Before we reach the end of the line, however:

459CUT TO THE FAR END OF THE LINE. In the center of the square, a crude, bizarre  spectacle: on a makeshift "throne" made from somebody's old, battered armchair, sits  General Zod. On a chair beside him, like a queen, is Ursa. Non, ever menacing, stands  beside the "throne." and -- sprawled at their feet insolently smirking -- in the classic jester post (legs crossed, head resting on arm) is Jak-El. A large table is set up before them; on it,  one at a time, the villagers lay their bounty down. At the head of the line is now an OLD WOMAN -- the elegant one we saw strolling with a parasol earlier -- weeping as she lays down some old rings and a pearl necklace.

OLD WOMAN It was me mother's . . . It's all I've got.

CONTINUED

459CONTINUED

JAK-EL That's all you've got? What a swell life you must have had.      (as she stumbles away) Why not kill the old ones anyway? They're  depressing.  ZOD They have sworn their allegiance to me.

JAK-EL So what? What are they going to do if an enemy attacks -- gun them to death?

A man at the head of the line lays down a lamb.

URSA    (a look of distaste) Another one of those disgusting animal things. They're disgusting.

ZOD It's the thought that counts, my dear.

46lEXT. AUSTRALIAN OUTBACK - ROAD - WHITE CADILLAC - DAY

where the four are still receiving tribute, seated on their "thrones."

JAK-EL I'm bored. What are we staying here for?

URSA                   (equally disenchanted)  Where else is there?

JAK-EL         (rising, petulantly)  There must be someplace else! Even the Phantom Zone  was more interesting than this.

As he looks at the table of booty, ANGLE DOWN as a farmer's hands place a watch and an old Bible there.  The farmer leaves, as the loot continues to pile up. HOLD on it, as:

ZOD (O.S.) Leave?! You fool! I am the leader here!

JAK-EL Leader of what? This bunch of garbage? If I see one more  rusty watch --

Suddenly, on top of the pile, a hand places. . . a contract and a pen. PAN UP TO SEE Lex  Luthor. He smiles nervously, rapidly chewing Kleenex.

LUTHOR Howdja do, Luthor's the name. No doubt you've heard of me. Lex Luthor, greatest criminal on earth?

URSA  I told you this was a puny, backward planet.

LUTHOR         (seizing the opening) You think this is earth? Listen lady. . .         (corrects himself quickly) Uh. . . Ms. This is nothing! This is the lounge. With your  talent you should be playing the main room. Y'know? y 'know?

As they move menacingly toward Lex:  LUTHOR Me? I can show you the bright lights! The big time!        (playing his trump card )  The son of Jor-El!

 REACTIONS: The four look stunned at this news. Cannot believe what they hear. Non utters  a howl, fist raised.

As Lois starts to protest, Clark COMES INTO FRAME.

CLOSEUP - CLARK, bristling with indignation.

CLARK Somebody ought to teach you manners.

TRUCKER         (rises; he's big)  You wanna try?

CLARK                                       (grim) Why don't we just step outside?

CLOSEUP - LOIS, looking very fearful.

l.A SHOT of the Trucker, out cold. on the ground.

2. A SHOT of Clark, standing in front of him.

3.A SHOT of Lois Lane, flushed, standing behind the fallen Trucker, a broken Coke  bottle in her hand.

CLARK What did you have to do that  for?

LOIS  What was I supposed to do? Stand by and let him  kill you?

CLARK I could have taken him.

LOIS You think you're some kind of a Superman?

CLARK          (defensively) I'm still in pretty good shape, y'know.

LOIS It's time you learned the facts of mortal life, darling. Such  as the cost of bridge work.

CLARK But --

LOIS        (gently} I'm not saying you might not have beaten this gorilla, but there would have been broken glasses, broken teeth  and broken who-knows-what before you did. Listen -- I Just got a man. I'd like to keep him in one piece.

As Clark stands there, frustrated, she comes to him, drops the bottle and hugs him.

LOIS It ain't no bed of roses being human, kiddo.

She gives him a sweet little kiss on the tip of his nose.

467EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY

LONG SHOT: On the West Side Highway, loading in to the 96th St. ramp, there is an incredible traffic jam of cars, trucks and station wagons leaving the city. Something very odd about this, which instantly shows us it isn't a normal situation: on the tops of the cars are suitcases, trunks, even items of furniture, bird-cages, etc., tied on. It looks like  a modern-day  Okie caravan. The cars are packed with families. in addition, we SEE certain yellow school busses, which have been papered with signs on the sides reading "EVACUATION TRANSPORTATION." Everywhere, POLICE in cars and on foot are evident, trying vainly to keep the traffic moving

NEW AGNGLE: The one lane of the highway leading in on the city has been blocked off with a police barricade. A cop car is planted there as well, and a POLICEMAN looks in annoyance as one lone car approaches: the rented car with Clark and Lois. He starts waving them back.

CUT TO 468INT. CAR - DAY

Clark and Lois totally befuddled by what they see around them.

LOIS What in the world -- ?

CLARK I know a lot of people go to the country for the  weekend but this is --

469EXT. WEST SIDE HIGHWAY  - DAY

The car advances, coming to a stop and the cop halts them.

COP Awright, where d'ya think you're goin', mac?

CLARK What is this? What's going on??

COP What's goin' on! Whaddya, blind?

LOIS We've been out of town, officer.

COP Doncha listen to the radio, for God's sake? The men  from Mars have landed.

CLARK The what??

COP Don't ask me, buddy. All I know is all hell's broke loose  and I got my orders, nobody gets in. So why don't you be a  nice fella and --

FAVORING LOIS: She reaches quickly in her purse and pulls out her wallet, flipping it open  to her Press card.

LOIS       (holds it up) Press. Let us through.

COP  Now look, lady --

LOIS It you want to get the Commissioner on the phone to  discuss the rights of the press, I'm sure he'd be glad  to talk to --

COP       (not too thrilled) Oh geez, you're Lois Lane, ain'tcha. I seen you on  the TV plenty of times.

He starts to move the barricade aside.

COP Okay, folks. But you ain't gonna like what you see.

470EXT. VARIOUS METROPOLIS STREETS - DAY  A SERIES OF SHOTS of streets, looking like London during the Blitz. Small fires raging. Certain buildings collapsed into rubble. Fire hydrants knocked over, water spouting uselessly. National Guard trucks, packed with soldiers, riding down empty streets. Police Riot Squads guarding broken store windows. The ambulances, SIRENS SCREAMING, speeding down broken streets.

CUT TO

471INT. PERRY WHITE'S OFFICE - DAY

CLOSEUP - PERRY WHITE, looking very harassed. PHONES RINGING constantly.

PERRY Four of 'em. Three ugly guys and a broad that  looks like the Queen of the Runway. They can fly,  they can do that heat vision fire thing -- everything Superman does, they do.

REVERSE: A shocked Clark and Lois talking to him.

LOIS But how --

PERRY The theory is when Superman set off that bomb in  outer space, he broke them out of some kind of jail  they were stuck in.

Clark -- a look of ashen horror. The guilt trip descends like a sledgehammer.

LOIS  What do they want?

PERRY Superman. The son of something or other, they call him.  They want Superman by midnight or they level the city.  They already made a pretty good start.

NEW ANGLE:. Door opens and TWO REPORTERS enter looking pretty beat.

FIRST REPORTER  I got the casualty figures, Chief. I don't know about  running the pictures, though. The hospital looks like a  battle station.

SECOND REPORTER What about the interview with the Mayor?

PERRY  Send Goldberg.

SECOND REPORTER  Goldberg's. . . one or the casualty figures, boss.

A beat of grim silence.

CONTINUED 471CONTINUED

PERRY Jesus. . . he gonna be okay?

The reporter shrugs.

PERRY Well, get somebody. . . anybody. . .

In the door comes Jimmy Olsen.

JIMMY I' II do it, Mr. White.                              (as Perry hesitates)  Please. I can write it. I've been a copy boy for a  long time, Mr. White -- I know what makes a  good story. . . ?

A pause. Perry looks at him. Then, gruffly:

PERRY Awright! But don't expect a byline on your first  story, Olsen!

As an eager Jimmy rushes out:

LOIS  What about me?

PERRY Get me something on this Superman bomb angle.  Background. Hit hard on the cheap irony angle.  Kent, get on the Lex Luthor angle.

CLARK         (what???) Lex Luthor?? ? Isn't he still in priso --

PERRY He's their front man. Came flying into town with the four  of  'em, blowing kisses to the crowd. Like a sultan on a flying carpet -- hey, that's not a bad whatchamcallit, simile.

He picks up phone.

PERRY Yeah. Two columns. Box the numbers.

A printer races in with a front page dummy: giant headlines METROPOLIS ATTACKED! He waits for Perry to approve it.

FOLLOW Clark and Lois out to:

472INT. CITY ROOM - DAY

Where it is bedlam and chaos, as the staff copes with the emergency. 

LOIS       (realizing) You mustn't feel. . . I mean, how could you have known?

CLARK         (overwhelmed) Yeah. . . how could I. . .

LOIS What can you. . . I mean. . .

CLOSEUP CLARK: Jaw clenched. Tight-lipped.

CLARK Something. I've got to do something.

He turns, starts quickly for the elevators. She turns after him, fearful.

LOIS  But you can get hurt. You'll be --

CLARK Hundreds of innocent people are being killed, Lois.  Because of Superman. They want Superman. If they get him, maybe they'll. . .

He leaves the sentence unfinished, turns and enters the elevator. The doors close behind him.  HOLD ON Lois, frightened.

CUT TO

473INT. COSTUME SHOP - DAY

TIGHT ON A TV SET: sitting on a shelf next to some dusty old costume hats:  sombreros, Roman Legionnaire helmets, etc. On the TV screen is a somber middle-aged man, seated at a desk bearing the Great Seal of Metropolis. This is THE MAYOR and he is in the middle of his talk.

MAYOR -- and we continue to wait and hope for some  word from Superman before that midnight deadline. Meanwhile, as your Mayor, I can assure you that  all that can be done is being done. Civil Defense units are doing a magnificent job in the stricken areas.  All leaves have been cancelled in the police and fire  departments. The President has declared the city a disaster  area and ordered National Guard units to be posted on full  alert. School buses and private cars are being used to evacuate  children, the aged and the infirm. A list of the evacuation  centers will appear in a moment. Meanwhile, I urge all  citizens of Metropolis to stay off the streets. . .

As this goes on and the CRAWL APPEARS with the addresses of evacuation centers, PULL  BACK TO REVEAL a very bizarre IMAGE: an old Jewish man holding a gorilla costume, crosses the little costume shop. Racks of typical outfits hang everywhere. The old man is the  PROPRIETOR of the store.

PROPRIETOR Look, you got wars -- depressions -- muggings.          (shrugs) So now you got mushuganahs flying in the sky. Believe me, it's always something. Hoodlums, gangsters, Muslims -- all I know is Al Felshman is alive and kicking, thank God, and people always need costumes, also thank God. You sure you don't want the gorilla? Very big this year.

He crosses to a curtained dressing booth and opens the curtain. In there stands Clark Kent half in an ill-fitting, somewhat baggy and faded Superman costume. As he puts his arm in the top part and zips it up:

CLARK          (adjusting the Shoulders            looking at himself in the mirror) No, thanks. Mr. Felshman. This is fine.

473CONTINUED

PROPRIETOR           (chacun a son gout) So, I'll put it nice in a box for you --

CLARK Don't bother, I'll wear it.

PROPRIETOR        (sure this is another meshuganah) Suit yourself.

CLARK       (by way of explanation as he         puts on raincoat and hat) I'm in a hurry.

He starts out. The Proprietor walks him to the door.

474EXT. MIDTOWN STREET, METROPOLIS - DUSK

WIDE: Evening is coming on; the sun is setting. In f.g. a troop transport truck rolling down 5th Ave., somewhere around The Plaza, filled with National Guard soldiers, bayonets in their hands. PAN WITH it as it turns down across street. In b.g. riot squad Metropolis Police are stationed at the end of the street, tense, edgy. From around the corner of' the street the truck came down, now emerges a curious sight: Clark Kent, "disguised" in raincoat, hat and glasses, but with his red Superman boots sticking out the bottom.

Trudging along oblivious to the world around him, he is muttering to himself like your  average New York nut case.

CLOSER ON HIM:

CLARK      (practicing a phony tough voice) All right, the jig is up!       (in his own voice and rather dismayed)  Not, that's not right. . .       (tries again; deep voice and an        accompanying gesture) Now you've gone too far -- you've made me mad!

CONTINUED

474CONTINUED

Suddenly, from O.S. a loud VOICE:

VOICE Hey! You!

Clark whirls, looks in the direction of the call.

NEW ANGLE : TEO RIOT SQUAD COPS across the street seeing him.

FIRST COP  Everybody off the street! That includes you!

CLARK Right. Right, I'm about to.

Quickly, he walks around the next corner. FOLLOW him.

ON THE COPS -- One looks at the other, makes whirling finger gesture to the head, meaning  "Another nut."

ON CLARK -- TRACK WITH HIM to a Con Edison construction site --- a hole dug in the  middle of the street, a wooden barrier in front of it. He ducks under it and quickly descends  into the hole.

CUT TO 

475INT. VON ED. HOLE - DUSK

A short iron ladder drops to a ledge down there. As Clark reaches the bottom, PULL BACK  to REVEAL:

476INT. SEWER TUNNEL

A vast echoing sewer tunnel; we HEAR the RUSH of WATER.

He walks a few feet to the left, then suddenly stops. He removes his coat and hat and lays  them down, then takes from the raincoat pocket a screwdriver and two firecrackers , He lays the firecrackers carefully on the raincoat (to keep them dry) and kneels. holding the screwdriver. What is he up to?

CLOSER ON HIM as he begins, laboriously, to unscrew a breaker panel on the floor of the  tunnel.

CUT TO

477INT. LUTHOR'S OFFICE - DUSK

As we HEAR a BELL (rather like am alarm) RING LONG and LOUD, we are on a BANK  OF TV BANKS MONITORS, each of which is labeled -- Park Avenue entrance, Fifth Avenue Entrance, 62nd Street Entrance, 59th Street Entrance. A light on this last set is blinking.

WIDEN SHOT to INCLUDE Luthor, Albert, and Eve.  LUTHOR Ah, visitors! Now who could be dropping in?

As Eve begins hastily smoothing her hair and fixing her lipstick as if for some real social event, Luthor presses a button on the TV monitor. The IMAGE APPEARS.

INSERT: CLARK - SUPERMAN

laboriously unscrewing the breaker panel to gain entry.

479ON LUTHOR

-- for a moment, he is shook up.

LUTHOR He's early. What's his rush?

ALBERT          (scared) We're alone! Those four said Midnight! He'll  hurt us!

 Luthor starts backing towards a tunnel:

LUTHOR Think I'll go for a walk. 

But suddenly, his attention is arrested by what he sees on the TV:

480HIS POV

The TV screen on which we SEE Clark-Superman unscrewing the last screw as we HEAR  Luthor exclaim:

LUTHOR (O.S.)          (startled) A screwdriver? All of a sudden he's got  respect for property?                                 (as C.S. removes breaker panel) What happened to the old razzle dazzle?                     (as C.S. picks up firecrackers) What now?

ALBERT (O.S.)                       (helpful)  Firecrackers. I believe.

LUTHOR (O.S.) I know that, Albert. I just don't know what. . .

As Clark-Superman takes out a book of matches, we HEAR a sudden exultant cry from Luthor. 

481ON LUTHOR

 very excited.

LUTHOR                    (Eureka!) Ah, but I do know! I do know!                      (excitedly) It's the machine!

THREE SHOT - A tiny, but significant pause while Lex waits for their appreciation and they  regard him blankly.

LUTHOR           (impatiently) That machine at his place.. Y'know? Y'know?           (to Eve) You thought it was the ladies' room, and I told you  it was a molecular restructuring thing? Well, the  flying fool must have put himself through it.         (it's delicious, triumphantly) And he's not flying anymore! He's lost his powers! He went and restructured his molecules!

EVE But why would he. . .

LUTHOR        (snappish) How do I know, Miss Teschmacher?  I'm not his  shrink. Thank God.         (happy again)  Ours is not to reason why, ours just to enjoy, enjoy.

ON LUTHOR. Gleefully, practically rubbing his hands together, he sinks into a great regal  armchair to enjoy, enjoy what is to come.

LUTHOR Boys and girls, get ready for the greatest show  on earth!

482INT. TUNNEL SHAFT

Clark-Superman removes the breaker panel and then, just before he jumps to the room below, lights and drops the firecrackers.

CUT TO 

483INT. LEX LUTHOR'S HALL

A pitiful son et lumiere show. The firecrackers BANG and in the little puff of smoke, Clark-Superman lands in a fierce pose like an ordinary guy trying to act like Superman (viz. George Reeves). Striking an heroic pose.

CLARK-SUPERM.AN         (the deep phony voice again) All right, Luthor. what are you trying to pull?

WIDE SHOT as Clark-Superman strides towards Luthor.

LUTHOR           (enjoying) And what are you trying to pull -- my leg?

483CONTINUED

Clark-Superman stops in his tracks, confused One last try:

CLARK-SUPERMAN         (the deep voice; warningly) The jig is up, Luthor!

LUTHOR         (to Eve and Albert) Cheap shtick ! Do you believe it? The fella does  impressions.         (to Clark-Superman) Can you do Cagney? That's my favorite.         (doing it himself) 'You dirty rats. . . '         (himself again and sneering) Your act needs work, kid. And you could start by  taking the price tag off your tochis.

ON SUPERMAN: A confused and embarrassed Superman, feeling around  and indeed  finding the price tag still dangling. Humiliated, he pulls it  off, tosses it angrily on the floor.

ON LUTHOR : rising from his chair now.

LUTHOR       (contemptuously) You're Superman, huh? Okay, try this. Feed  the pets.

He gestures towards the alligator tank.  ON SUPERMAN: confused, looking at the tank. 

ON LUTHOR: an evil grin.

LUTHOR Feed 'em your foot.       (scornfully) You're not Superman anymore than I am.  Probably less.

An inspiration. TRACK WITH him as he crosses quickly to a wall where hangs a pair of heraldic crossed swords, part of the rococo decor of the lair. He seizes one and whirls around  to confront Clark-Superman.

CONTINUED

483CONTINUED

LUTHOR I think I'll cut you down to size.

He begins backing him into the hall, toward the alligator tank.

WIDE SHOT: Albert and Eve flattened fearfully against a far wall as, in f. g. Luthor and  Clark-Superman square off and circle each other warily.

LUTHOR       (brandishing the sword)  Have at you!

484 INT. LUTHOR'S HALL

Waving the sword "wildly, but with some menace, he is backing Clark-Superman towards  the alligator tank. Feinting, ducking, Superman climbs the ladder. Luthor in pursuit.

LUTHOR                    (doing all the moves)  Thrust! Parry! bullseye!

And he hurls the sword right at Clark-Superman. It WHISTLES through the air. 

ON CLARK-SUPERMAN, feinting at the last moment. The sword misses him by an inch  and sticks, quiveringly, in the wall behind him. They move onto the ledge, above the tank.

WIDE SHOT: And now the advantage is with Clark, who advances on Luthor ready to try throwing a merely mortal punch. But Luthor immediately begins shadow-boxing, darting  quick blows at Clark-Superman. Surprised, Clark-Superman can only keep ducking and  feinting. Luthor stops abruptly; they are at a standoff.

LUTHOR          (to Albert) Well. Albert, it looks like we won't. . .          (a wildly significant look)  Play ball. Y'know?           (as Albert looks blank) Y'know??   The light dawns in Albert's face and he nods quickly.

TIGHT TWO SHOT: Luthor and Clark-Superman facing each other. Clark-Superman looking frustrated and humiliated , Luthor smiling mockingly at him.

LUTHOR Big mistake, pal. Because it's the bottom of the  ninth for you.

WIDE SHOT: And Albert is now creeping up the ledge behind Clark-Superman, wielding a  baseball bat.

LUTHOR         (still smiling) And Lex Luthor has last licks!

And on that last word we are ON Superman, FULL SHOT as the baseball bat comes  crashing down on his head with incredible violence. We HEAR the mighty CRACK and expect to see his head split, but it is the bat that splits. Inexplicably, not a hair is out of place.

A SERIES of QUICK CLOSEUPS -- REACTION SHOTS: Albert staring at the jagged butt  end of the bat in his hand; a wide-eyed Eve, a shocked Luthor, literally back-tracking and  last and most stunned, Clark-Superman, touching his head in gingerly disbelief.

WIDE SHOT: Everybody in shock, Luthor recovering fastest. He gestures towards the  broken bat.

LUTHOR        (explaining) They don't make those things the way they  used to.         (quickly) The brick Albert, the brick!                    (as Albert scurries for it,          to Clark-Superman, almost           reassuringly) This should do it.

Albert runs at Superman, obviously about to brain him with a flip of his brick.

ON SUPERMAN: Venturing something. Concentrating, he aims his Heat-Vision. (EFFECTS) We HEAR a cry of pain from Albert.

ON ALBERT:  shaking his smarting hand, staring at the melted brick he's dropped.

ON EVE: she looks very nervous, a fluttery smile flitting on her race. She begins chewing  on the chain she wears around her neck -- whatever is its pendant is under her sweater or  blouse.

EVE        (quietly, timorously; to herself) Oh, boy,  am I gonna get yelled at. . .

ON LUTHOR, who hasn't even looked her way, still staring at Superman in disbelief.

LUTHOR Impossible!

ON CLARK-SUPERMAN: just as bewildered. 

SUPERMA.N Beats me. . .

ON EVE: cast o'er with a sickly pale.

EVE         (to herself') 'Clumsy, butterfingered idiot,' he's going to say.  'How could you. . . '

She fingers the necklace.

ON LUTHOR: frustrated, suddenly a wild hope. He runs to his office; Superman follows, as do the others.

LUTHOR Wait! Don't move! I've got it here somewhere. . .

485INT. LUTHOR' S HALL - NIGHT

TWO SHOT: Searching frantically, Luthor starts pulling out desk drawers. Superman takes a  large bronze candlestick off the desk. Is he going to brain Luthor? No, he's testing his  powers, bending it easily in half.

ON EVE: watching this with sick dismay.

EVE        (tiny voice) In ten seconds, that's when he'll start yelling. Ten  seconds I give it. Ten. . . nine. . .

CONTINUED 485CONTINUED

WIDE SHOT: As Superman carefully replaces the ruined candlestick, Luthor straightens up.

LUTHOR Voila!

He has found what he was looking for: a Thompson sub-machine gun.

LUTHOR         (confident again) Okay!                     (to Superman, as if he were          about to take his picture) Could you just face me a little more?

And Clark-Superman, in an increasingly happy daze, complies

ON EVE:

EVE Seven. . . six. . . 

486ON LUTHOR: HE squeezes the trigger and FIRES off a ROUND.

487ON SUPERMAN: The bullets bounce off.

LUTHOR              (hysterical) But it's impossible! You did go through that  machine, didn't  you?

SUPERMAN                    (furious) Machine? How did you know about that  machine, Luthor?

LUTHOR I. . .uh. . .was in your neighborhood and. . .

With a gulp,  like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar,  she pulls the necklace pendant  from her bosom.  It is the glowing red crystal from the machine.

EVE                     (a teeny weenie voice)  You...mean this?                    (weakly) I thought it was pretty.

He charges at her, but is stopped midway by the grasping hand of SUPERMAN, which lifts  him a foot off the ground.

SUPERMAN Hold it!

488NEW ANGLE

As Superman grabs he enemy, we NOTE that he seems suddenly to expand in power and musculature. As if by magic, his costume is no longer baggy or ill-fitted or faded. His very being  seems to have the old aura back again. Superman!

 SUPERMAN                   (hard as nails) Now, you pitiful little crackpot, you're going to start  telling me what I want to know or your foot is going  to feed the alli. . .

Suddenly, as LUTHOR trembles in abject cowardice, the VOICE of GENERAL ZOD booms out in the vast lair.

ZOD (O.S.) Luthor, you insignificant insect! You promised us the  son of Jor-El! Where is he Luthor? Fulfill your promise or prepare to die on the...

Immense relief floods over LUTHOR'S face at the SOUND of the VOICE, as the startled SUPERMAN lets him go and looks up.

489ANGLE UP: Standing, feet planted apart, arms akimbo, on one of the steel cross-beams is  General Zod. Scattered on other ledges high up are Ursa, Non, and Jak-El.

LUTHOR Ah, General! I thought you'd never get here. I don't  suppose you've met, have you. Superman, these are some folks from your old home town come to say  hi. Well, I'll just let you all have a nice little chat now  I'm sure you've got all kinds of things to talk over -- old friends, old memories, singing the old school songs. . .

ZOD  I am General Zod!

SUPERMAN Big deal.

ZOD           (stridently) You will bow to the four of us! especially me!

WIDE, LONG: The four above, Zod pointing down to Superman imperiously. 

SUPERMAN I think you need to be taken down a peg.

490And with that: EFFECT: A beam of heat vision Shoots from our hero's eyes and strikes the  steel beam Zod stands upon. It glows and melts beneath his feet, sending Zod crashing down  to the floor.

491Instantly:

JAK-EL        (deprecatingly) Oh that. Who can't do that?

492From their three perches, the three beam heat vision (EFFECTS) on the floor Superman  stands on, cutting a section around him as neatly as a laser beam.

493NEW ANGLE as the chunk of floor gives way and sends Superman crashing down to the  basement level. Debris and dust fly.

494ON LUTHOR, EVE AND ALBERT: watching wide-eyed, scared.

LUTHOR My carpets! Be careful of my carpets!

ON SUPERMAN: a bit stunned as he lifts himself out of the debris.

SUPERMAN       (wonderingly) This is going to be harder than I thought.

ZOD        (above) Now, son of Jor-El! Kneel and beg my forgiveness!        (holds out his hand)  You will kiss my ring!

SUPERMAN         (pointing to his monogrammed chest) You can kiss my  'S.'

495He hurls a chunk of broken metal at the leaping Jak-El. FOLLOW IT: As Jak-El ducks, the  metal SMASHES against a wall, not merely cracking it, but bringing the entire wall down  along with its paintings, scabbards, books, etc.

496ON LUTHOR AND EVE: He is apoplectic.

LUTHOR         (sputtering) Stop it! Stop it! This is my home! You are destroying  a man's home!

EVE       (tentatively) Try to think of it as interior decorating, Lex.

LUTHOR          (homicidal) I'll decorate your interior, you stupid, screwed up,  smart mouthed. . .

And she flings it full force at Superman, FOLLOW IT: He darts away, as, to our amazement, the table goes not five or ten feet, but whizzes across the full length of the room, smashing the opposite wall. It crashes the wall down, cracking an iron water main pipe concealed in the wall.

CLOSER: A the pipe cracks, gallons of water begins gushing into the lair with the force of  geyser.

498REACTIONS: LUTHOR, EVE, ALBERT . . .in a panic.

LUTHOR A bucket! Albert, get a bucket!

ZOD Humble yourself, son of Jor-El! Bow to your leader!

ON SUPERMAN: as ha takes off, flying up toward Zod. 

SUPERMAN You sure like to hear yourself talk, huh? Well  I'm just going to have to close that mouth for you.

500NEW ANGLE: As Superman comes, Zod gives the signal to Non. With a cry, the beast springs from his perch and charges full-force at Superman, butting him with his head squarely in the chest. The terrible blow has a remarkable effect on Superman. For the first time he is hurt. Reeling, he lets out a cry of pain, which is truly frightening to us who never heard that before from him, and falls to the ground.;

A beat of terrible silence.

SUPERMAN      (amazed, rubbing his chest) Pain. . . This must be pain. . .

ON EVE: a look of pity.

EVE Awww. He was always a real gentleman to me.

WIDE

ZOD Admit defeat, obstinate fool! Bow and proclaim  Zod your master!

SUPERMAN         (rising) You, a master? You're nothing but a slave to your own  sick mind.

ON ZOD: seething with rage.

ZOD So, this is the answer, is it?

ON LUTHOR: as he sees it's going to start again.

LUTHOR                 (pitifully, almost in tears) Aw, c'mon, people, can't you go and play somewhere else?  ZOD Still you resist! Then others will pay for your stubborn  attitude! Innocent people.       (as if it were an insult, spitting it out)  Humanity!

501And with that, he leaps from his place and flies straight up through the hole in the ceiling.

LUTHOR I thought they'd never leave.      (suddenly in command again) Albert, get a broom. Miss Teschmacher, the mop  is in the utility room, what are you waiting for, a  printed invitation?       (as they scurry off; to Superman) Would you mind moving out of the way? I've got  a little spring cleaning to do here and you're in my. . .

Suddenly, O.S., coming from above on street level: a horrible SCREAMING of people in  pain.

503MED. CLOSEUP - SUPERMAN: His reaction is instantaneous. He flies straight out and up.

CUT TO

504 EXT. CITY STREET, METROPOLIS NIGHT

As Superman emerges, a terrible sight awaits him. We ARE IN THE INTERSECTION of a  busy midtown Metropolis section. On one corner, a tall, modern glass-fronted skyscraper. On another a big department store. A hospital building down the street. The area is well lit,  not only by street lights, but by big electric signs advertising various products or naming various companies, which sit on the roofs and ledges of the surrounding buildings, The Daily Planet building among them. One of these gigantic signs has been toppled, crushing about  twenty people in the middle of the intersection. Many are dead. Some crawl away, hurt. Other people, a large crowd, are running in panic from the apocalypse, taking shelter in the lobby of the department store, crushing into the available space, to avoid the devastation taking place.

(NOTE: The following scene, although detailed carefully here, moves at rapid pace, one event following another in FAST CUTS so that there is no time for reflection on the part of  the audience, nor) for that matter, on the part of Superman.)

In QUICK CUTS, then:

5051.The WIDE SHOT and VARIOUS ANGLES, SHOWING what has just happened.

5062.Survivors of this first disaster, yelling, run to the safety of the department store      entrance.

5073.Superman seeing all this, looking up to where the sign fell from.

5084.PAN UP:  Jak-El, giggling has pushed the sign. As he leaps from the now-empty  rooftop, over the skeletonic sign foundation, PAN TO General Zod, on another height.

ZOD Son of Jor-El! Bow! Bow and acknowledge the  superior power of General Zod!

5095.INTERCUT CROWD seeing Superman . Superman rushes to the fallen victims,   when:

5106.JAK-EL, on another ledge, pushes over another sign. It falls with a crash, injuring the slower of the fleeing people.

ZOD Kneel! Swear loyalty to Zod!

Stopped in his tracks, Superman -- for whom everything is happening too fast, faster than he  can stop it -- races to the second sign, when:

O.S. : SCREAMING of young children.

511ON SUPERMAN: who spins around to see why.

512HIS POV:  NON, across the street, hold over his head a mini school bus, which has been  converted into an evacuation vehicle, as evidenced by the sign posted on its side, the suitcases on its luggage rack. Inside the bus, about 15 children, a few nuns, a driver, scream in terror as Non rocks the bus from side to side as he holds it aloft, sending the passengers tumbling over each other.

513ON SUPERMAN:

SUPERMAN No!

514NEW ANGLE: Before he can, NON hurls the school bus at the side of a concrete building. It  crashes and EXPLODES.  

SUPERMAN Don't!  Don't do this! Why are you doing this?

JAK-EL Cause you're so cute when you're  mad.

CONTINUED

514CONTINUED

ZOD On your knees,  son of Jor-El!

O.S. the biggest SCREAMING yet. Many people in a panic.

515ON THE DEPARTMENT STORE: The mob that took refuge in there now comes charging  out, in panic and hysteria, screaming.

516CLOSEUP - SUPERMAN: He doesn't know why.

CUT TO

517INT. DEPARTMENT STORE LOBBY - NIGHT

WIDE SHOT: behind the fleeing crowd, is a wall of flame. Behind the wall of flame is Ursa,  heat-vision emanating from her eyes, as she forces them into the open.

CUT TO 

518EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT

As the crowd rushes out into the street.

CUT TO

519EXT. ROOF - DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT

ANGLED DOWN, WIDE, OVER THE BACK OF JAK-EL, his hands poised on the enormous electric sign of the Department store. Just as the crowd below turns out into the target area, he tips the sign over, screeching with glee:

JAK-EL Bombs awayyyyyy! 

520The sign crashes down on the crowd. Enormous destruction.

ZOD Bow down! Bow down and submit, you  son of Jor-El!

As if he were saying "sonofbitch."

521ON ZOD: Drawing himself up to full strength on his lofty height, he aims his ferocious eyes  at what is across the street.

522WIDE: (EFFECTS) The beam from his eyes hits the vast glass front of the skyscraper.

ON THE GLASS FRONTED SKYSCRAPER: A crack appears, with a mighty SOUND, like  the crack in an egg - jagged from top to bottom. An instant later, the windows  start to pop  and fly, some bursting out into the street, some going inwards.

INTERCUT:

5231.SHOTS of OFFICE WORKERS hit by the flying glass inside, screaming, falling.  CLOSEUPS of faces cut, eyes bleeding, heads covered with broken shards of glass.  Panic. Hysteria.

5242.SHOTS OF SUPERMAN: unable to prevent it. Horrified.

5253.SHOTS OF ZOD: shouting his importunities. The others, wild.

5264.THE CROWD ON THE STREET, those who have survived, massed together, are  amazed at Superman's inaction. Cat calls and expressions of disappointment. Some  yelling, "Get 'em! Get 'em!"

537ON SUPERMAN: He stands there, impotent, not knowing where to turn. Then:

VOICE OF URSA  Superman! Over here!

528PAN UP, WIDE: JAK-EL is now on top of the Daily Planet building, sitting astride the great  electric  globe that festoons the roof of the newspaper offices. Non is now on the ledge of another building across the street. Zod is on his perch, right angles to Non. Completing the  square is Ursa who sits on the awning of a building whose faade reads METROPOLIS  CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL.

JAK-EL Come on, local boy, Make good.

URSA      (taunting) Is de widdle man tired?

ZOD We noticed a pavilion in the children's hospital  dedicated to you. Why don't you check yourself in with the rest of the sick and weak!

529ON SUPERMAN: Looking every which way, a terrible inner struggle going on inside him. Jaw clenched, fists tight, he stands immobile.

530ON THE CROWD: Waiting, watching.

531ON SUPERMAN: He flies up, as if to confront the villains, but then, halfway there, he suddenly whips into a turn and zooms away, darting off through the buildings into the night. he is gone.

532ON THE CROWD: Some cannot believe it. Expressions of dismay. TWO BLACK KIDS, 8  and 10, with "street smarts " beyond their years, look at the sky, their cynicism confirmed.

FIRST BLACK KID        (scornfully) Huh. Superman Didn't even do nothin'.

SECOND BLACK KID                   (calling up to the sky,                    the ultimate put-down) Jive turkey!

The SOUNDS of the awful LAUGHTER of the four can be HEARD:.

533ON THE ROOFTOPS: The four are rocking with laughter.

JAK-EL  Never even threw a punch!

URSA A coward like his rather. Like all men.

As Non growls horrendously.

ZOD        (delighted) And did you see his face when I asked him to  bow and he. . .        (the laugh stops suddenly) . . . he did not bow.         (looking wildly around)  Where has he gone? Where is he?

CUT TO 

534INT. LEX LUTHOR' S HALL - NIGHT

A very delicate operation is in process. Albert stands none too steadily at the top or a rickety ladder hammering a metal patch on the broken water pipe, while Eve, half way up the ladder, passes him nails, and Luthor, at the foot of the ladder, steadies it. Signs of hasty repair are  everywhere: buckets, towels, pans, etc. pressed into service.

LUTHOR If I never see any of them again, it's too  soon for . . . 535Suddenly, with a mighty whoosh, the four villains descend from the hole in the ceiling, knocking down the ladder as they do, causing  Albert to fall, the patch to come loose, the  water to start gushing again.

LUTHOR       (beside himself) Why me? Why me? Isn't there any other louse in  this city who deserves grief and heartbreak? Does it always have to be. . .

Non grabs him by the neck, and growls, teeth showing.

LUTHOR        (trying to smile)  Hi, there.

ZOD           (angry) Where is he? Where is the son of Jor-El?

LUTHOR Can't you people ever hold onto your property? Again  with where is. . .                   (suddenly brightens)  Ohhh, lost him, have you?

Non releases him. Luthor brushes himself off.

ZOD Where has he gone?

FAVORING LUTHOR: as he gets the old confidence back. With a strut and a stagger and a  wink to Eve and Albert;

LUTHOR  It so happens I'm the only one in the world who has  the answer to that question.

URSA Where?!

LUTHOR Not so fast. This time we make a deal.

CONTINUED

535CONTINUED

ZOD Deal? General Zod make a deal??

LUTHOR        (blithely) Suit yourself. Kill me if you want to.                  (as Non approaches) What will it get you, aside from a national day  of' mourning? Deal me in and you get your pigeon.

ZOD Where does he go?

LUTHOR The address? What for? More of' that 'Bow, yield,  kneel' routine? I saw it. It was a flop. A floperoo.

ZOD       (pure hatred)  No more or that. This time we will kill him!

Non howls.

ZOD Kill him!

LUTHOR N.G. He's as strong as any one of you.

ZOD But not as strong as the four of us! One by one, we fail. But together. . . together we will tear him limb from limb.

ON EVE: trembling, she backs away.

LUTHOR         (exultant) Now you're talking, y'know? Y'know?      (grabs a Kleenex pops          it in his mouth) Any of you folks care for a. . . well, anyway . Do we  have a deal?

CONTINUED

535CONTINUED  (2)

 JAK-EL What is it you want, earthling?

LUTHOR I figure you'll take over the world in about a week,  right? Right. Well, it's a big place, the world. And  my needs are small. As it turns out, y'know, I have a certain weakness for beachfront property and. . .

ZOD       (enough already)  What do you want ?

CLOSEUP - LUTHER : a big smile.

LUTHOR Cuba.

CUT TO

536INT. FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE - NIGHT

A brooding, disturbed Superman, his face a portrait of tortured emotion, sits at his master console, looking at a TV screen. As he brushes back a lock of hair, wincing from a bruise, which we see for the first time, MOVE INTO TV screen until it FILLS OUR FRAME.

537INSERT: On the TV screen is SEEN the back porch of the White House in Washington, D.C. where the PRESS SECRETARY is holding a news conference, surrounded by gentlemen ofthe press.

PRESS SECRETARY         (very serious) The President has asked me to read the following statement.          (reading) 'These are grave and terrible events, which threaten the  very existence of our planet. I have, therefore, as your  Commander in Chief, placed all armed forces on emergency status. All leaves and furloughs are cancelled until further  notice. There is little we can do against interplanetary forces  bent on wanton destruction, however. We must look to a higher  power and pray that the five creatures abandon their willful activities and allow us to live in peace.'

CONTINUED

537CONTINUED

REPORTER Excuse me, did you say 'Five'? I don't understand.

PRESS SECRETARY  Yes, five. The President! considers Superman equally  responsible -- perhaps 'irresponsible' is a better word. . . for this terrible destruction.

538REVESE FROM TV SCREEN TO SUPERMAN WATCHING: Stung to the quick, he gets  up, switches it off, walks toward the area where, he communicates with his father, almost literally stooped with the weight of the world on his shoulders.

PAN HIM OVER TO the shelves where the memory crystals are kept. He takes one of the  last crystals on the second wall - the wall where Luthor got his information -- and walks  toward the activating device.

CUT TO

539EXT. SKY - NEAR NORTH POLE - NIGHT

The four villains are flying. Luthor rides on Non's back .

LUTHOR                            (to Ursa, flying alongside) My ears are popping, y'know.

She turns away in disgust.

LUTHOR No drinks. No movie. This is the last time I take a  charter flight.

CUT TO 

540INT. FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE - NIGHT

Jor-El has materialized and is listening to Superman's grim tale.

SUPERMAN . . . but I couldn't save the world. My being there  just made things worse.

JOR-EL So you came here.

CONTIUNED

540CONTINUED

SUPERMAN       (nodding) And here I sit. . .        (bitterly) In my own little Phantom Zone. Staying out of trouble.        (shakes his head) But I'm kidding myself, aren't I? I've Just defaulted. . .  left the world to them.

JOR-EL          (nodding quietly) And sooner or later they will find you anyway.

SUPERMAN           (despairingly) Isn't there anything I can do?

Amazingly, the image of Jor-El begins to fade away as if he has clicked himself off.

CLOSEUP - SUPERMAN: Terrible anxiety.

Then, suddenly, the image of Jor-El grows to full strength again. A forthright expression in  his eyes.

JOR-EL  There is one solution. And only one.

CUT TO

541EXT. SKY NEAR THE FORTRESS - NIGHT

LUTHOR  There! Down there!

ZOD I see only ice.

LUTHOR Trust me. Did I ever let you down?

The word down becomes a gibbering cry, as they suddenly zoom downwards, Lex hanging  on for dear life. His race looks like it's being pressured by 800 g's.

LUTHOR If you people could Just do something about this turbulence  problem, we could put TWA out of business.

542INT. FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE - NIGHT

ON SUPERMAN: as he stands by the control panel of his console, pushing various buttons, activating various crystals. We don't know exactly what he is doing, but it sure looks important.

VOICE OF LUTHOR Yoo hoo! Anybody home! Hey, Stupid man! You've got company! 

543 SUPERMAN activates the mechanism (same one Albert fooled with earlier) that causes one wall of the Fortress (EFFECTS) to become opaque/transparent so that he can now see what is out there.

544WHAT HE SEES: The four and Luthor, ranged across his "front yard."

LUTHOR Don't blame me, dummy! You're the one who blew it! All you had to do was compromise a little - I mean, so  you kneel once, what's the big deal, a little dust on your  knee? But no, you had to be macho man. They would've made you a deal, y'know. You could have been king of the United States maybe! At least Governor of North Dakota! But no, you had to go and make them mad. Hey listen, Superman, can you hear me? When these guys get mad  it males me look like Winnie the Pooh. Now they want to  kill you! What can I say? I'm going to miss our little chats, y'know. Y'know? Hey, in there. . . send up a flare, or something. Let us hear from ya!

During this, CUT FROM Superman's INSIDE POV TO:

545EXT . FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE - NIGHT

ZOD  Enough of this! Son of Jor-El, prepare to die!         (to Non) Smash the door!

Non rears back and hurls himself at the door. The second he hits it (EFFECTS): An enormous ZAP! of Kryptonian electricity sends him reeling him back, stunned. He lies in the snow, doesn't know what hit him.

JAK-EL  Let's take it from the top.

Jak-El, leaps to the roof of the Fortress.

546ON THE ROOF: As the wiry imp crawls between icicle points, looking for a means of entry, a second set of icicle-like points suddenly rises from the roof, intersecting with the first  group. As these touch Jak-El (EFFECTS): Another ZAP! of electricity gooses him up and  off. He falls to the ground.

547ON THE GROUND LEVEL:  They all cluster around Zod, feeling a bit foolish.

LUTHOR I don't know. . . for me the door was always open.

ZOD We have forgotten our plan. Four.  We are four. It is the strength of four that will defeat our enemy. 

He gestures to them, manipulating them into a flying wedge, pointed at the doorway.

ZOD  Together! Now!

In a fearsome display of raw power, the four leap, fly like bullets, and hit the door  simultaneously. Again there is a tremendous ZAP! of electricity, but it isn't strong enough to  withstand their combined super-power. The door crashes and splits and they are inside. 

CUT TO 

548INT. FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE. - NIGHT  As they race in, each looking around wildly for their prey, smelling blood. Behind them,  Luthor trots in.

WIDE: But. . . the enormous interior seems to be empty. No sign of Superman.

ZOD Show yourself, coward! Son of a coward!

CUT TO

549INT. MOLECULAR RESTRUCTURING CHAMBER

There is Superman inside. He can see them through the glass window. Quickly he puts a red  crystal -- a duplicate of the one we saw on Eve's necklace in its proper place in the crystal  panel bank. Then, he flings open the door and stands in the doorway of the chamber.

 SUPERMAN Anytime! Come and get it!

CUT TO

550INT. FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE - NIGHT

The four see him now, and, with cries of fury, begin to race toward the chamber. 

Superman takes a few steps inside.

But, when they are almost there:

LUTHOR     (yelling frantically) No! Don't go in there! It's a trap! It's a trap!

NEW ANGLE: The four stop in their tracks.

QUICK CLOSEUP - SUPERMAN: looks upset.  LUTHOR Don't set foot one in that thing! I know what it is! It's a molecular restructuring thing!

ZOD            (snarling) A what?

LUTHOR It makes you into an earthling! It turns people like you in to. . .        (feels funny saying this) . . . people like me.

ON THE FOUR: They shrink back in horror, then turn appreciative eyes on Luthor.

ZOD We could have been. . .!                   (to Luthor) You have done well, Lex Luthor. We will award  you this Cuba place. 

ON SUPERMAN: He glares daggers at Lex Luthor. He looks as furious as we have ever seen  him be.

SUPERMAN Luthor, you poisonous little snake. . .  CONTINUED

550CONTINUED

ON THE FOUR:  A gleam of pleasure appears in Zod's eyes. 

ZOD An earthling?                  (savoring it) It turns a Kryptonian into an earthling?

LUTHOR            (smiling) Like a man into a mouse.

URSA         (almost salivating)  Then a 'Super' man. . .  JAK-EL . . . becomes a Super Mouse!

ZOD                (a sadistic smile; his first       smile of the movie) My friends. . . this amuses your General.     (suddenly; frighteningly fierce) Seize him!

They spring at Superman and grab him -- literally limb by limb, one on each leg and arm. It  is an awful spectacle, as Superman vainly kicks and struggles, his eyes contorting with fear.

SUPERMAN  No! No! Please Don't!

His pleas are in vain. . . they hurl him into the chamber. Zod slams the door shut and seals it.

ZOD Lex Luthor! Ruler of the Cuba place! Activate  this machine! Make the child of our jailer into a  crawling slave so that we may destroy him as easily as. . .

ON LUTHOR: as he runs toward the chamber.

LUTHOR Say no more, General. It's my pleasure.

And he pushes the starting mechanism. Immediately:

551WIDE: Something odd (to us, not to them) happens. The sudden spectacular changes of lights, colours, spotlights and so on that we saw earlier when Superman entered the chamber  begin to happen again. . . but this time they happen in the entire interior of the Fortress, and not in the Molecular Restructuring Machine.

SHOTS: 1. WIDE as the lights change. 2.  INSIDE THE MACHINE, Superman sits bathed in ordinary room light. 3.  The colors and lights pass across the faces of the villains - red, green, blue.

But this time a new color, or set of light changes, occurs -- something we did not see the first  time when the machine was lacking one important crystal.

At last the process ends. The lights in the Fortress return to "normal." The four, as well as  Luthor, observed all the phenomenon with curiosity, but now that it seems to have ended  they are grinning with anticipation, each wanting to be the one who gets the first shot.

JAK-EL Let me . . . 

URSA No, I want to . . .

Non emits, a mighty howl.

ZOD      (evil benevolence) Non. . . my faithful Non. . .  you may do the honors.

FAVORING NON: Practically drooling with anticipation walks to the chamber and opens the lock. MOVE IN: SEE Superman in there. Hesitantly, he walks out the door, standing in  front of Non.

With an idiot grin and a lunatic grunt of amusement, Non points to his chin, which he  proffers, as it to say, "Go ahead, hit me." Superman  stands there a moment. (Mother of Mercy, is this the end of Rico?). Now he clenches his fist. Now he raises his arm. Now Non  grunts mockingly. Superman hauls back and socks.

553WHAMM! The punch sends Non flying across the entire length of the  entire room, crashing  into the far wall, out cold.

554QUICK REACTION SHOTS: URSA, JAK-EL, ZOD, LUTH0R. . . how  could this be???

ON LUTHOR: A gibbering idiot, trying to figure it out, terrified.

LUTHOR He. . . he switched it! The old switcheroo! He was on the inside looking out, we were on the outside looking. .                                 (blathering) The wrong place at the wrong time! It isn't fair! He  turned it around! Put it in reverse! How could he do it?

MED, CLOSEUP - SUPERMAN:  with a beaming smile, he looks skywards and makes a  jaunty little salute.

SUPERMAN Thanks, Dad.

NEW ANGLE: URSA, spitting with rage, charges at him.

URSA I'll kill you! I'll destroy you!

As she springs at him, fingernails out, he grabs her, yanks her over and turns her over his knee.

SUPERMAN This is how we treat naughty girls on earth, Ursa.

He spanks her butt soundly. She howls.

ON ZOD: Cowering in a corner of the room; Jak-El behind him.

NEW ANGLE: Superman dumps Ursa on the floor, stalks towards the General. He grabs him  by the lapels with one hand.

ZOD No!

 SUPERMAN General Zod, consider yourself dishonorably discharged.

555With his free hand, he strips the epaulets from General Zod's shoulders. Then, grabbing him  with both hands, he raises him and hurls him across the room. Zod crashes into Jak-El and  both wind up in a heap.

556ON LUTHOR: on his knees.

LUTHOR        (trembling) Listen, Superman, don't do anything rash. Don't be  hasty. I'll be nice. I'll be your best friend. I'll change  my ways.

POV: LUTHOR: ANGLE UP, Superman, advancing on him.

SUPERMAN Now then, Luthor, as for you. . .

LUTHOR (O.S.)  Please! I'll turn over a new leaf. A hundred leaves!  Trees! Forests!

SUPERMAN        (coming closer)  Too late, Luthor.

CUT TO

557INT. MOLECULAR RESTRUCTURING CHAMBER  - SPACE

CLOSEUP LUTHOR: (The CUT to the CLOSEUP makes it seem as if we are still in the  Fortress. Lighting on Luthor's face is the same, so we believe the following line is coming immediately after Superman's last speech).

LUTHOR      (wildly hysterical) No! No, don't hurt me! Please don't hurt me!

CAMERA PULLS BACK: suddenly we SEE that we are now inside the Molecular Restructuring Chamber, but still TIGHT ON Luthor, so that it seems we are still in the  Fortress.

LUTHOR You, can't kill me! I'm a genius! I'm Lex Luthor! I'm the only one who can get us out of here!

CONTINUED

557CONTINUED

PULL BACK CONTINUES AND WIDENS: Now we SEE that locked inside with him areGeneral Zod, Ursa, Non, and Jak-El, and outside the window is nothing but the black void of outer space.

ZOD Every bone in your body, Luthor.

URSA Limb from limb. Limb from limb.

JAK-EL You got us into this!

URSA  Limb from limb.

LUTHOR      (wheedling, conniving, figuring,       hustling Lex Luthor to the last) Gimme a break, I'm the only one who can get us out  of here!        (waves his slide rule) Give me time! I'll figure out a plan!

They advance on him, cornering him in the glass cage.

LUTHOR Y'know? 'Y'know? Y'know? Y'know?

558PULL BACK THROUGH SPACE. The chamber gets further and further away until it is merely a dot, lost among the stars. Then:

A circular frame appears around this view of the starry sky.

CUT TO

559EXT. ROOF OF SKYSCRAPER - OSSERVATION TOWER (EMPIRE STATE . BUILDING)

To REVEAL the source of the circular VIEW. A telescope on an observation platform. Eve Teschmacher is looking through it. She waves sadly into space.

CUT TO

560INT. DAILY PLANET - CITY ROOM - DAY

TWO SHOT: by the elevators, where Clark Kent, having just come in, is standing still -- literally hat in hand -- for a dressing down by Perry White. All the while, Clark stares over Perry's shoulder with a look of puzzlement.

PERRY C'mon, Kent, you're the tenth guy to do that number  about the subway not running. When I started  out. . . back before the wheel was invented. . . reporters  knew how to walk to work. (turning to go, a word of advice) A little exercise wouldn't kill you.

REVERSE as they turn, and we now SEE what has been bothering Clark - beneath a great  jagged hole in the ceiling stands the huge electric globe which was on the roof until Jak-El  started cavorting on it. Obviously, as a final gesture, he sent it crashing down into the middle  of the room. Plaster and dust are all around it and workmen with ropes and tackles are struggling to budge it.

PERRY            (shouting to them) The world is too much with me! Will you get that  thing out of here?        (to Clark) A parting present from the flying freak show.        (to the panting, puffing workmen) Where am I supposed to put my movie critic?!         (to Clark) He said it was the best thing he's seen in years. But he  thought he'd work at home. . .         (raising his voice to the workmen) . . .while they take their sweet time !

And off he stalks.

HOLD ON Clark, who barely has time for a shake of the head and a tiny private smile  before Jimmy Olsen dashes up to him carrying the latest edition.

JIMMY Clark, wait'll you see. . . my first story!

CLARK  Hey, congratulations!

560CONTINUED

Jimmy holds out the paper. 

CLARK Front page?

JIMMY Well, not exactly.      (he opens out the paper to         about page 30, points to         the bottom undaunted) But he did give me a byline.

CLARK        (reading it) James Arthur Olsen. . .

JIMMY           (seeing it on a Pulitzer)  Yeah. . .

CLARK             (a grin, a slap on his back)  Way to go, James!

TRACK WITH him as he goes to his desk. halfway there, he is stopped by a conspirational  call.

LOIS (O.S.)  Clark! Clark!

He turns, crosses quickly to her.

TWO SHOT: he stands beside the desk. She sits at her typewriter, a typewritten page in thedesk and another in the typewriter. She is very "up," very excited.

LOIS Tired, darling?

She takes his hand. He smiles down at her too, but he seems hesitant. As if sensing this, she  goes right on talking very quickly, very brightly.

560CONTINUED  (2)

LOIS Well, you're not the only one who's been busy. Wait  until you - I mean, I haven't told anyone yet -- well, I  haven't even had time to tell anyone - that I have written  the story of' -- well, the story. This is 'stop the presses!' time.         (a little laugh, but she is not           getting much encouragement          from Clark; she hurries on) Anyway, I thought  you should be the first to --

She pulls the page out of the typewriter and hands it to him with the other page. He sits down  on the edge of' her desk.

 INSERT: The top page whose headline reads: SUPERMAN'S IDENTITY REVEALED."  Almost instantly, it is turned and a second page is SEEN for a second.

ON CLARK: rather ashen-faced, a strained smile as he hands it back to Lois.

LOIS       (quickly, lightly)  Super-speed-reading -- the best or all powers!       (anxiously) So -- what do you think'?

CLARK  Well, it's quite scoop. . . 

LOIS       (happily) It is, isn't it? Of course, the only thing is. . .      (lowering her voice, conspiratorially) . .  .how did you do it? How did you get back  to being. . . well, super? That's the only part I haven't got.  Did you go back to that machine? Or did your father have some other --

CLARK Lois --

560CONTIUED  (3)

LOIS      (a laugh) Okay, okay, later for the investigative reporting.      (more seriously) Well, I mean later f me. You know there's really no reason  for you to be a reporter at, all. You don't need that cover  anymore. Why should you trudge around, unappreciated, just old Clark Kent when --

CLARK           (quietly) But I liked it.

LOIS      (quickly, taking his hand) Oh, sweetheart, so did I.      (a mischievous grin) But isn't it true Superman has more fun ?      (as he looks faintly troubled) And so will I. It's true, I promise you. Oh, I know, I was  upset by what your father said -- about you being. . . special. But I've been thinking --      (a little toss of  the head) -- well, he never knew me. I'm -- no false modesty, right? -- well, I'm special too. I'd never stop you from what you have  to do -- I'd be pretty dumb if I couldn't see how the world -        (a gesture to the great globe near them)  -- needs you.        (she lets go of his hand) How can I -- look, my friend Barbara, she's married to a doctor and he's worse than you.

CLARK Huh?

LOIS Well, hospital night duty, teaching, clinics, emergency calls -- he's never home. And she's survived. So okay, Superman --       (a quick look around; her          voice ever lower) --  you've got your. . . career. Well, I've got mine too. But weekends -- (MORE)

CONTINUED

560CONTINUED  (4)

LOIS       (happily) -- we can fly anywhere -- Rome! Paris! Casablanca! By the time we've named it, we'll be there!      (he seems about to cut in) Or -- yes, we might just want to relax. I know a little place  up north --        (she smiles up at him) -- where we could be. . . snowed in. I always wanted  to  learn to ski.

As he smiles at her - loving her however uneasily at this moment -- she rolls the second page quickly into the typewriter again.

LOIS So, tell me how you got those super-powers back again.  because I also always did want to win the Pulitzer prize.

CLARK            (rising; quietly) I'll drink to that.

TRACK WITH him as he steps quickly to the water cooler, fills two transparent plastic cups  with water; He stands a second, looking down at one of them.

561EFPECTS: His eyes widen (SPECIAL EFFECTS) and the water glows, changes color, and  then goes back to normal.

562It is the cup that he hands to Lois.

TIGHT TWO SHOT - as she raises her cup and he slowly raises his. They both smile. But  her eyes are happy and his are full of pain.

LOIS Here's looking at you, kid.

CLARK Yeah. . .

As she drinks, slightly turned away, he looks at the page in the typewriter and on her desk.

INSERT: The pages have gone blank.

ON LOIS -- blinking, shaking her head, rather as if coming out of a reverie. Frowning, she regards the blank paper in her typewriter.

CONTINUED 562CONTINUED

LOIS Now what was I about to -- ?                    (looking up) Clark? What did I say I wanted to work on?        (apologetically) I always get groggy when I  skip lunch.

CLARK           (thinking) Let's see, it was -- it was about Superman. How he saved  the city -- or the world -- or the universe --

LOIS           (mock-scolding) Clark Kent, jealousy is a counter-productive attitude.

CLARK         (wryly) I'll try to remember that.

LOIS After all, there are things you can do.

CLARK Yes?

LOIS Yes. Like getting us a pizza.

Clark leaps to his feet.

 CLARK Pizza!

And he dashes out.

HOLD ON Lois -- watching him go, a little startled and very pleased. 

LOIS Now that's what I call service!

CUT TO

563EXT. PISA, ITALY - DAY

REPEAT OF SAME SHOT AS EARLIER  -- Early morning, and the hands of' the  SOUVENIR SELLER rolls up the awning on his stand. We now SEE that the shelves have been filled with spanking new plastic Towers of' Pisa and postcards to match the new version: all the towers stand upright. PULL BACK, REVEALING the now once-again smiling, happy, contented Souvenir Seller and, in the b.g., the upright Tower. ZOOM  PAST IT to a blue dot in the sky.

CUT TO 

564EXT. SKY ABOVE PISA - DAY

ON Superman as he flies.

SUPERMAN       (shamefaced grin, to himself) So it's supposed to lean. I'm a kid from Krypton -- how was I to know. . . ?

Grinning he starts to descend.

565WIDE SHOT: He arrives at the top of the Tower, starts to push it back down again so that it  will lean once more.

CUT TO  566EXT. SOUVENIR STAND - PISA - DAY

Where our ,an once again admires his stock, looks to the real thing, looks back and then does a double-take worthy of Edgar Kennedy in his prime: for the Tower is now the LEANlNG TOWER again and all his wares are useless. Hysterical, he smashes shelves to  the ground, makes violent obscene gestures at the caped hero above, and, weeping and  screaming:

SOUVENIR SELLER  Cretino! Stronzo!

. . .and other expletives deleted.

CUT TO

567EXT. SKY - DAY

All problems attended to, he flies majestically home, soaring toward the blue horizon,  magnificent in his power, at ease in a world that welcomed him to its atmosphere. Faster than  a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single  bound. Look -- up in the sky! Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No! It's SUPERMAN

THE END
