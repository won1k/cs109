    AZEEM
    
    You're fast with a sword my friend
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Five years I've waited for the smell of free air, that makes a man fast.

    Azeem and Robin run for the guards on horses
    Why did you let me free, Christian?
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Whatever blood is in your veins, no man deserves to die in there.
    Some guards pass their hiding place
    Farewell, my friend, God'll speed your way
    
    AZEEM
    
    Our way lies together. With the speed of Allah. You have saved my life. Christian. Now I'll stay with you, until I've saved yours. That's my vow.
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

    AZEEM
    
    Only Allah can do that
    
    ROBIN

    4 INT./ EXT./LOCKSLEY'S CASTLE, ENGLAND
    
    LORD LOCKSLEY
    
    Kind Sir, It's rumoured that you fought in King Richard's crusade with my beloved son, Robin. I fear you are returned home to desperate times. When dark forces plot against our absent king. I'm anxious for words of my son. Were you present at his capture near Jerusalem? Do you know the name of the potentate who holds him? Does he still bear me ill will? A little news, please sir. I would give all that I own for his release.
    
    DUNCAN
    
    Not now!
    
    SERVANT
    
    Help me, my Lord!
    
    DUNCAN
    
    You should have waited. I'm sorry you were disturbed, master.
    
    LORD LOCKSLEY
    
    Duncan, it's alright. Let him go:
    
    SERVANT
    
    They have taken my Gwen.My daughter..
    
    LORD LOCKSLEY
    
    Who has taken?
    
    SERVANT
    
    Men on horses, in masks. We tried to stop them, but:My son is dead. He's dead!
    
    DUNCAN
    
    Master, stay. There's an evil moon tonight.
    
    LORD LOCKSLEY
    
    Never fear, Duncan. The good will overcome. Trust in that.
    
    SERVANT
    
    I'm sorry, my lord. I had no choice
    Man on horse takes his mask of; it's the SHERRIF of Nottingham
    
    LORD LOCKSLEY
    
    You!
    
    SHERIFF
    
    Locksley:
    
    LORD LOCKSLEY
    
    The king will hear of this!
    
    SHERIFF
    
    Join us
    
    LORD LOCKSLEY
    
    Never!
    SHERIFF
    
    Join us, or die!
    
    LORD LOCKSLEY
    
    For God and King Richard!
    
    CUT TO
    
    5 EXT./ ENGLISH COAST
    
    Little boat approaches the British coast, Robin and Azeem and some others are in it. Robin kisses British ground.
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Oh, thank you Lord. I'm home! I'm home!!!
    
    AZEEM
    
    You are strange Christian
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Yes, but I'm free. And now I beg you to free yourself of your vow. Return with the boat.
    I know how it feels to be so far from your home and family
    
    AZEEM
    
    Because I love them so much, I cannot dishonour them.
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    I'd thought you'd say that.
    
    AZEEM
    
    Azeem's attacked, but wins the struggle
    No one controls my destiny. Especially not one who attacks with down wind and stinks of garlic.
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Come, Azeem. Our fighting days are done. By nightfall, we'll celebrate with my father.
    You'll understand of course, I had to try.
    
    AZEEM
    
    I would have succeeded.
    
    CUT TO
    
    6 EXT./ ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE
    
    Robin and Azeem are walking over a stone wall
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Why must you walk at the back of me?
    
    AZEEM
    
    In you country, am I not the infidel? It's seem safer to appear as your slave, rather then your equal
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    For an infidel, you have uncommon clarity of thinking. And you'll tell me nothing of yourself. For instance your name; Azeem, what doe sit mean?
    
    AZEEM
    
    Great one
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Great one? Really? Did you give yourself this name? It was a joke! Azeem the great one! I'm home! Look! Mistletoe. Many maids lost their resole to me thanks to this little plant.
    
    AZEEM
    
    In my country we talk to our women, we do not drug them with plants
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    What do you know of women?
    
    AZEEM
    
    Where I come from, Christian, there are women of such beauty. That they can poses a mans mind so, that they would be willing to die for her.
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Wait. Was that why you were to be executed? Because of a woman?
    That's it, isn't it? That's it!
    
    AZEEM
    
    It is close to sunset
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Who was she? The Mullah's daughter? Another man's wife? What's her name?
    
    AZEEM
    
    Is there no sun in this cursed country? Which way is east?
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Her name
    
    AZEEM
    
    East?!
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Her name
    
    AZEEM
    
    Yasmina
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    That way!
    Robin points Azeem to the East
    
    AZEEM
    
    You are sure?
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    I would know blindfolded, I'm five miles from home. Was she worth it?
    
    AZEEM
    
    Worth dying for

    You're dogsmeat, son, you know that?
    
    SOLDIER 2
    
    Get down here, you now what you've done. Down!
    
    GUY
    
    You're not playing by the rules, boy! Deer don't climb trees. Perhaps he thinks he's a gay bird! Shall we teach him to fly?
    
    SOLDIERS
    
    Yeah!
    
    GUY
    
    Get him down!
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Hold! I'm curious:what man or creature is so fearsome that it takes six men to attack it.
    
    GUY
    
    This is no affair of yours
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Or are we treating the devil himself? A small boy. A truly dangerous animal
    
    GUY
    
    He killed one of the Sheriff of Nottingham's deer
    
    WULF
    
    We were starving! We needed the meat!
    
    GUY
    
    I advice you to move on, pilgrim, this is the Sheriff's land
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Wrong, this is my land and my tree. So whatever's in it also belongs to me
    
    GUY
    
    Might I have the pleasure of your name, before I have you run through?
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Robin of Locksley
    
    GUY
    
    Well, well, Locksley. Welcome home!  Kill him!
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Azeem, it's time to redeem that vow!
    
    GUY
    
    Release the hounds!!
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Get up, Azeem!
    Points his swords in Guy's neck
    Now, sir. If you'd be so kind to give me your name, before I run you through:
    
    GUY
    
    Guy of Gisborne, the Sheriff's cousin. The little bastard was poaching deer
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Poaching? Is it not a greater crime to starve a family?
    
    GUY
    
    Go on, Locksley, go on
    
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    I've seen enough blood spilled to last two lifetimes. Now get off my land! And tell Nottingham what happens to scum when they pick on small children!
    And you! (tegen Azeem) you've travelled ten thousand miles to  save my life and then leave me to be butchered?!
    
    AZEEM
    
    I fulfil my vow's when I choose!
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    And that does not include prayertimes or mealtimes or any time I'm outnumbered by six to one?
    
    AZEEM
    
    You whine like a mule. You're still alive!
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Have no fear, come down boy. Is it true boy, did you kill a deer?
    
    WULF
    
    Hundreds of them!
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    You've scared him
    
    AZEEM

    Guy enters the Sherrif private rooms by climbing some stairs. The Sherrif is in his room with a whore.
    
    GUARD
    
    Hold on, sir! The Sheriff doesn't want to be disturbed!
    
    SHERIFF
    
    Cousin. I trust you justify your intrusion with news of profound value?
    
    GUY
    
    I met a hooded man today who made me warn you not to harm his people
    
    SHERIFF
    
    Who told you to cover up? His name?
    
    GUY
    
    Robin of Locksley
    
    SHERIFF
    
    The prodigal son returns! He's a whelp. This girl could vest him! Put it There!
    
    GUY
    
    Well, this whelp, has vested four of my men
    
    SHERIFF
    
    Your men were probably drunk! But you survived, cousin!
    
    GUY
    
    I've barely survived. He has a companion, a dark skinned foreigner with a dark face of Islam and a Saracens sword
    
    SHERIFF
    
    Yes yes, I'm sure it would take an army to match these roves
    Locksley must have visited his manor and find the home fire still burning!
    
    CUT TO
    
    9 EXT./ INT./ RUINS OF LOCKSLEY'S CASTLE - NIGHT
    
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

    AZEEM
    
    Who is it?
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    It's my father:Who's there, who's there?
    
    An old man appears in the ruins of the castle
    
    DUNCAN
    
    Master Robin, is that you?
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Duncan?
    
    DUNCAN
    
    Oh, praise thy, I thought that God had abandoned us
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Duncan, my father!
    
    DUNCAN
    
    It's a miracle:
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Why didn't you cut him down?
    
    DUNCAN
    
    Never thought to hear your voice again:
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Are you deaf?
    
    AZEEM
    
    Easy!! Look at him!
    
    DUNCAN
    
    I would have done it, if I could see.
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Who did this to you, Duncan?
    
    DUNCAN
    
    Guy, Guy of Gisborne:and the SHERIFF and his witch looking on
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Why?
    
    DUNCAN
    
    They said the Sheriff captured your father worshipping the devil. He has signed a confession before the bishop
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    No, that's not possible!
    
    DUNCAN
    
    Nottingham declared all of Locksley's land forfeited
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Do you believe the charges?
    DUNCAN
    
    Not even when they took my eyes
    
    CUT TO
    
    10 EXT./ IN FRONT OF LOCKSLEY'S CASTLE
    
    
    Robin, Azeem and Duncan knealing around Locksley's grave.
    
    AZEEM
    
    We must go
    
    DUNCAN
    
    He loved you 'till the end, young master. He never gave up hope of your return
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    I should have been here
    He called the crusades a foolish quest, he said it was vanity to force other men to our religion.
    
    DUNCAN
    
    You must (vluchten) now, head south to safety. Gisborne will surely seek revenge
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    I hear you, Duncan.
    To Azeem You should go home. My world is turned upside down here. And I can not ask you to come where I'm going.
    
    AZEEM
    
    Alone Christian, you'll only get yourself killed. Besides there's nothing left for me to go home to
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    I will not rest until my father's revenged. I swear it by my own blood!

    The son of a dead man
    
    SHERIFF
    
    Locksley! Does he affect us?
    
    MORTIANNA
    
    He proceeds the Lionheart
    
    SHERIFF
    
    If King Richard returns from the Crusades, that could prove a bit awkward. It will suffer the support of the barons. Soon?
    
    MORTIANNA
    
    Make haste!
    
    SHERIFF
    
    But my plan, is it still intact?
    
    MORTIANNA
    
    Aaaahhhh!!!
    
    SHERIFF
    
    What's wrong?
    
    MORTIANNA
    
    I've seen our death. The painted man, he horrors my dreams, with strange foreign motifs

    Thank you. With the king away, we must guard us from villainous outlaws, who would kidnap a relative of his.

    Surely you can see that I'm not one of those

    I would my lady, but I've sworn to protect you.

    Protect me? Robin of Locksley was nothing but a spoiled bully. And besides as you can see, we have enough protection.

    This is Nottingham, trying to divide us
    
    WILL SCARLET
    
    We are divided, rich boy. I'm not as blind as that old man over there. You're still trying to be lord of the manor. I heard today that the sheriff now values your neck at five hundred goldpieces. I say we take him in!
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Will, do you think that the sheriff will give everything back when I'm gone?
    
    WILL SCARLETT
    
    They'll give us the reward and our pardons
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Wrong. He'll stretch your necks one by one.
    
    WILL SCARLET
    
    Well, what will you have us do? Fight men on horsebacks with rocks and our bare hands?
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    If it needs to be
    But with the one true weapon that escapes you, Will. Courage
    
    WULF
    
    Look out!
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Thank you, Wulf. Wish to end this? Wish to go home? Then we must stop fighting amongst ourselves! And face that the price worth may be dear:But I for one would rather die and spend my life with hiding. The Sheriff calls us outlaws, but I say we are free! And one free man defending his home is more powerful then ten hired soldiers. The Crusades taught me that. I will make you no promises, safe one; that when you truly believe in your hearts that you're free then I say we can win!

    Yeah, but what about our kids? The sheriff has taken all they've got to.

    I was lost after my mother died. My father too and for a short time he found comfort in the arms of another woman. I thought he was betraying my mother's memory. For the love of a twelve years old boy who would never forgive him. Anyway, who says I'm content? I've my plans for the future

    So you can not find the way back, when you're forced by others to tell the way.
    It was good to see you again, Marian.
    
    MARIAN
    
    It was good to be seen
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    I have two favours to ask of you:
    
    MARIAN
    
    One:?
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Take Duncan with you. I fear for his health for what lies ahead. Besides I grew tired of his bellyaching.
    
    DUNCAN
    
    You wish me to leave, master Robin?
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Old friend, listen to me. Can you bring Lady Marian safely home? I fear for her safety.
    
    DUNCAN
    
    Of course, Sire!
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Good. Bull?!
    
    MARIAN
    
    And two?
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    Yes, two..
    You're King Richard's cousin. You can give word to him of Nottingham's plans. He would believe you.
    
    MARIAN
    
    If the sheriff found out, I could loose al that I have
    
    ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY
    
    But will you do it for your king?
    
    MARIAN
    
    No, I'll do it for you!
    
    DUNCAN
    
    He fancies you, my Lady. I'm blind, but some things I can still see.

    I'm truly sorry, my lady. He wasted his life. How many more lives would you waist?
    What a beautiful, child. So young, so alive, so unaware of how precarious life can be.
    I had a very sad childhood, I'll tell you about it sometime. I never knew my parents. It's amazing I'm sane.
