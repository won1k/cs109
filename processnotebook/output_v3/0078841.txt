    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    
    	FADE IN:
    
    1	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAWN
    
    	A large-screen color TV dominates a room sparsely decorated
    	with expensive furniture of the twenties.  There are no
    	books, magazines, newspapers to be seen.  A man, CHANCE, is
    	in bed, sleeping.  His eyes slowly open, and, with no change
    	of expression, he sits up and turns on the TV with a remote
    	control.  He reaches for a pocketwatch on the bedside table,
    	and, as he looks at it, the watch chimes.  He gets out of
    	bed, crosses to the closet, his eyes never straying from the
    	TV.  Chance puts on a bathrobe and leaves the room.
    
    2	INT. POTTING ROOM - DAWN
    
    	The room is filled with the tools of a gardener.  Chance enters
    	and turns on a 1940's black and white TV that sits on a shelf.
    	A wheel with colored gels spins in front of the set, giving
    	an early form of color television.  He waters a few of the plants
    	in the potting room as he watches TV.
    
    3	INT. GARAGE - DAWN
    
    	Chance, with a dust rag and feather duster, cleans off a 1935
    	limousine, in perfect condition.
    
    4	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAWN
    
    	Chance takes off his robe, hangs it in the closet, changes
    	channels on the TV, then goes into the bathroom.
    
    5	EXT. GARDEN - MORNING
    
    	A light snow is falling in a garden between a three-story
    	brick townhouse and a one-story rear building, guarded on
    	either side by a high brick wall.  The door to the rear
    	building opens, Chance peeks out, then goes back inside.  A
    	moment passes and Chance reappears, this time with an
    	umbrella.  Smartly attired in suit and tie, Chance, with an
    	eye on the garden, crosses to the townhouse.
    
    6	INT. TOWN HOUSE - REAR ENTRANCE/HALLWAY - MORNING
    
    	Chance enters, hangs his umbrella on a door knob, then
    	crosses through the hall.  As he goes, we reveal that the
    	furniture in the house is covered with sheets.
    
    7	INT. TOWN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MORNING
    
    	A large table, covered with a sheet except for two place-
    	settings.  A TV is on the table.  Chance comes into the
    	room, sits and turns on the television.  He watches the
    	screen for a moment, then turns, as if expecting someone.
    	No one appears, so he turns back to the TV.  After a time.
    	footsteps are heard and Chance smiles.  LOUISE, an elderly
    	Black maid, hurries into the room, visibly distraught.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Good morning, Louise.
    
    				LOUISE
    			(out of breath)
    		He's dead, Chance!  The Old Man's
    		dead!
    
    				CHANCE
    			(flatly, turns
    			back to TV)
    		...I see.
    
    				LOUISE
    		Must of happened durin' the night,
    		I don't know...Lord, he wasn't
    		breathin' and as cold as a fish.
    		I touched him, just to see, and
    		you believe me, Chance - that's
    		doin' more than I get paid to
    		do...  Then I just cover him
    		up, pulled the sheet over his head...
    
    
    				CHANCE
    			(nodding)
    		Yes.  I've seen that done.
    
    				LOUISE
    		...Then I get the hell out of that
    		room and call the doctor and I
    		think I woke him probably, he wasn't
    		any too alert.  He just said, 'Yeah,
    		he's been expectin' it and said he'd
    		send somebody over...'  Lord, what a
    		mornin'!
    
    				CHANCE
    			(watches news,
    			flashes of season's
    			first snowfall)
    		...Yes, Lousie, it's snowing in
    		the garden today.  Have you
    		looked outside and seen the snow?
    		It's very white.
    
    	A beat of silence from Louise, then anger.
    
    				LOUISE
    		Gobbledegook!  Dammit, Boy!  Is
    		that all you got to say?  More
    		gobbledegook?
    			(Chance smiles,
    			is silent)
    		That Old Man's layin' up there
    		dead as hell and it just don't
    		make any difference to you!
    
    	Lousie takes a long look at Chance, then softens, sits
    	next to him.
    
    				LOUISE (Cont'd)
    		Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know
    		what I was expectin' from you...
    		I'm sorry for yellin' like I did...
    		No sir, I just don't know what I
    		was expectin'...
    			(Chance doesn't
    			react, watches TV)
    		...I 'spose I'd better gather up
    		some breakfast for you...
    
    				CHANCE
    			(a turn to her)
    		Yes, I'm very hungry.
    
    				LOUISE
    			(rises, looks upstairs)
    		Well, no more stewin' those prunes
    		every mornin', that's somethin',
    		I guess...
    			(she starts out,
    			stops by the door)
    		...What are you goin' to do now,
    		Chance?
    
    				CHANCE
    			(gazing at TV)
    		I'm going to work in the garden.
    
    	Louise gives Chance another look, then turns to leave.
    
    				LOUISE
    			(as she goes)
    		...I'll get you some eggs.
    
    	Chance nods in approval, then changes the channel on
    	the TV.
    
    8	INT. TOWN HOUSE - SERVANT'S STAIRWAY - MORNING
    
    	An enclosed stairway.  Chance enters, proceeds up the
    	stairs.
    
    9	INT. TOWN HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MORNING
    
    	Chance comes out of the doorway adjoining the main stair-
    	case.  He moves off down the hall.
    
    10	INT. TOWN HOUSE - OLD MAN'S ROOM - MORNING
    
    	The furniture in this room is not covered with sheets -
    	but the Old Man is.  There is a knock a the door, then
    	Chance enters the room.  He stands by the bed for a moment,
    	Then reaches down and pulls the sheet back from the Old
    	Man's face.  He touches the man's forehead, briefly, then
    	replaces the sheet.  Chance moves to the the TV and turns it
    	on.  He sits in an easy chair next to the Old Man's bed
    	and watches a movie from the early forties.  Chance puts
    	an arm out, rests it on the Old Man's covered body.  He
    	becomes absorbed in a scene in which a gentleman tips his
    	hat to a lady.  The scene seems to have 'sunk into' his
    	mind.
    
    11	EXT. GARDEN - MORNING
    
    	It has stoppped snowing.  Chance, wearing a hat, and a
    	gardening apron over his suit, putters in the garden.
    	Louise, dressed warmly, comes out of the main house.  Chance
    	sees her, tips his hat exactly like the man he saw on
    	television.
    
    				LOUISE
    		...Well, ain't you the gentleman
    		this morning...
    			(a pause)
    		...I'm gonna go now, Chance...
    
    				CHANCE
    			(resumes working)
    		Yes.
    
    				LOUISE
    		You're gonna need somebody, some
    		one's gotta be around for you...
    			(he keeps working)
    		...You oughta find yourself a
    		lady, Chance...
    			(she smiles slightly,
    			with caring)
    		...But I guess it oughta be an
    		old lady, 'cause you ain't gonna
    		do a young one any good, not with
    		that little thing of yours...
    			(she reaches out,
    			puts a hand on his
    			shoulder)
    		...You're always gonna be a little
    		boy ain't you?
    			(he smiles, keeps
    			working)
    		...Goodbye, Chance...
    
    	Lousie hugs and kisses Chance, then turns to go.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(as she goes)
    		Goodbye, Louise.
    
    	Louise waves as she enters the townhouse.  Chance tips
    	his hat once again as she disappears.
    
    12.	INT. TOWN HOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - MORNING
    
    	Louise enters the hallway, picks up a couple of suit-
    	cases waiting by the door.  She stops as she sees TWO
    	Men carrying a stretcher down the main staircase.  A
    	THIRD MAN, a mortician, follows behind.
    
    				LOUISE
    		...He used to be a big man...
    		'Spose he wasted away to about
    		nothin'...
    			(a beat - then
    			she talks to the
    			body of the Old
    			Man)
    		I guess I'll be goin' off to
    		find me some folks, Old Man...
    		I'm not batty enough to stay
    		around this neighborhood any
    		longer...
    
    	The stretcher bearers move to the front door.  Louise
    	steps in front of them.
    
    				LOUISE
    		Wait up!  I'm goin' out that
    		door first.
    
    	Louise takes one more look at the covered body, then
    	openes the front door, leaves.
    
    13	EXT. GARDEN - DAY
    
    	Chance's pocketwatch chimes as he looks at it.  He
    	removes his gardner's apron as he walks toward the
    	townhouse.
    
    14	INT. TOWNHOUSE DINING ROOM.
    
    	Chance enters and sits at his place.  He turns on the TV,
    	and watches for a moment, then turns, looks for Louise.
    	She does not appear so he resumes watching TV.  He changes
    	channels, views a wildly exciting game show.  At a
    	peak in the excitement, he again switches channels to news
    	coverage of the President of the Unite States greeting
    	foreign dignitaries at the White House.  CLOSE SHOTS on
    	television reveal that the President uses a two-handed
    	handshake when meeting his guests.  Chance grips one hand
    	with the other, the scene on TV seeming to have 'sunk into'
    	his mind.
    
    15	INT. TOWNHOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - DAY
    
    	A key is heard in the lock.  The door opens and THOMAS
    	FRANKLIN and SALLY HAYES enter.  Franklin, an attorney, is
    	in his late thirties, carries a large breifcase.  Hayes is
    	younger, attractive, also an attorney.  She totes a brief-
    	case, has the look of a modern woman.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    			(as they enter)
    		He and my father used to ride to-
    		gether back in the thirties...
    		Fox hunting... Before I was born...
    
    				HAYES
    			(looking around)
    		Will you give me a tour?
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		Gladly...
    			(he smiles)
    		...The safe is in Mr. Jenning's
    		bedroom, that'll be stop number
    		one.
    
    	Franklin puts a hand on Hayes' shoulder as they go toward
    	the stairway.  Suddenly, they stop, listen to the off-
    	stage TV.
    
    16	INT.  TOWNHOUSE DINING ROOM - DAY
    
    	Chance still watches TV as Franklin and Hayes appear in
    	the doorway.  They are surprised to see Chance.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		...Why...Hello, we thought we
    		heard something...
    			(moves to Chance,
    			hand outstretched)
    		...I'm Thomas Franklin.
    
    	Chance remains seated, takes Franklin's hand warmly in
    	both of his like the President did on TV.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Hello, Thomas...I'm Chance,
    		the gardener.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    			(a beat)
    		...The gardener?
    			(thinks it's a joke,
    			laughs)
    		...Yes, of course...Mr. Chance,
    		this is Ms. Hayes.
    
    	Hayes moves to shake Chance's hand.
    
    				HAYES
    		Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to
    		meet you.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(doesn't rise,
    			again shakes with
    			both hands)
    		Yes.
    
    	Chance turns back to the TV.  Hayes and Franklin ex-
    	change looks, there is an uneasy pause.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		We're with Franklin, Jennings
    		and Roberts, the law firm handling
    		the estate.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(a smile, totally
    			at ease)
    		Yes, Thomas - I understand.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		...Are you waiting for someone?
    		An appointment?
    
    				CHANCE
    		I'm waiting for my lunch.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		Your lunch?  You have a luncheon
    		appointment here?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Louise will bring my lunch.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		Louise?... The maid?...
    			(a look to Hayes)
    		But she should have left earlier
    		today...
    
    				CHANCE
    			(smiles at Hayes)
    		I see...
    
    				FRANKLIN
    			(a beat)
    		All kidding aside, Mr. Chance,
    		may I ask just what you are doing
    		here?
    
    				CHANCE
    		I live here.
    
    	Franklin stares at Chance as Hayes unzips her briefcase.
    
    17	EXT. GARDEN - AFTERNOON
    
    	Chance talks to Franklin as Hayes quickly checks through
    	some paperwork.
    
    				CHANCE
    		The Old Man himself used to
    		visit my garden.  He would
    		read and rest here.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		Come now, the deceased...
    			(catches himself)
    		Mr. Jennings was bedridden for
    		at least the last thirty-five
    		years, since he fractured his
    		spine.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes, Thomas.  Then he stopped
    		visiting my garden.
    			(points to a small
    			area)
    		I planted a lot of tulips right
    		there.  I like to watch them
    		grow.
    
    				HAYES
    			(looking up
    			from papers)
    		There is no mention of a gardener.
    		In fact, according to our inven-
    		tories, there hasn't been a man
    		employed here since 1933...except
    		for a Mr. Joe Saracini, a brick
    		mason, who did some repairs to a
    		wall.  He was here for two-and-a-
    		half days in 1952.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes, I remember Joe.  He was very
    		fat and had short hair and showed
    		me pictures from a funny little
    		book.
    
    				HAYES
    		...Some pictures?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  Of men and women.
    
    				HAYES
    		...Oh.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		Just how long have you been
    		living here, Mr. Chance?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Ever since I can remember, since
    		I was a child.  I have always
    		worked in the garden.
    
    				HAYES
    		...The you really are a
    		gardener?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.
    			(again points off)
    		...My roses...
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		...We will need some proof of
    		your having resided here, Mr.
    		Chance.
    
    				CHANCE
    		You have me, I am here.  What
    		more proof do you need?
    			(he starts toward
    			rear building, points
    			off)
    		That's where Joe fixed the wall.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    			(starts after Chance)
    		Are you related to the deceased,
    		Mr. Chance?
    
    				CHANCE
    		No.  I don't think so.
    			(looks back to garden)
    		In the springtime, you will be
    		able to see my flowers.
    
    	Chance goes into the garage.  A perplexed Franklin and
    	Hayes follow.
    
    18	INT. GARAGE - AFTERNOON
    
    	Chance enters, Franklin and Hayes close behind.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    			(looking at limo)
    		That's a nice car.  Do you drive
    		it, Mr. Chance?
    
    				CHANCE
    		I've never been in an automobile.
    
    				HAYES
    		You've never been in a car?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Oh, no.  I've never been allowed
    		outside of the house.
    
    19	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
    
    	Chance turns on the TV as Hayes and Franklin inspect the
    	room.
    
    				CHANCE
    		I used to listen to the radio,
    		then the Old Man started giving
    		me television sets, this one
    		has a remote control...I like to watch...
    			(motions to bed)
    		You see?  This is my bed...
    			(to closet)
    		...This is my closet...
    			(to bathroom)
    		...This is my bathroom...
    
    				HAYES
    			(goes to closet)
    		You have a very handsome ward-
    		robe, Mr. Chance.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  I am allowed to go to
    		the attic and use the Old Man's
    		clothes.  They all fit me very
    		well.
    
    				HAYES
    		It is amazing how these clothes
    		have come back into style.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		Could you show us something with
    		your address?  A driver's license,
    		a checkbook?  Anything to show
    		that you were employed here?
    
    				CHANCE
    		I don't have any of those things.
    
    				HAYES
    		How about a birth certificate?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Oh, no.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		What are your plans now, Mr.
    		Chance?
    
    				CHANCE
    		My plans are to work in my
    		garden.
    
    				HAYES
    		How much money did Mr. Jennings
    		pay you for your work?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Pay me?...Why nothing.  I've
    		never needed money.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		Mr. Chance, I would like to know
    		what sort of claim you are plan-
    		ning to make against the deceased's
    		estate.
    
    				CHANCE
    		I'm fine, Thomas.  The garden is
    		a healthy one.  There is no need
    		for a claim.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		I see.  Would you be willing to sign
    		a paper to that effect?
    
    				CHANCE
    		No, Thomas.  I don't know how to
    		sign.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		Come now, Mr. Chance.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(smiles)
    		I have no claim, Thomas.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		But you won't sign, correct?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes, correct, thank you.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		Very well, Mr. Chance.  I have
    		no alternative but to inform
    		you that this house is now
    		closed.  If indeed, you have
    		resided here, you have no legal
    		right to remain.  You will have
    		to move out.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Move out?  I don't understand,
    		Thomas.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		I think you do, Mr. Chance.
    		However, I will reiterate.  This
    		house is closed and you must
    		leave - by, let's say - noon
    		tomorrow.
    			(he gives Chance
    			his business card)
    		Call me if you change your mind
    		about signing.
    			(turns to Hayes)
    		C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...
    
    				HAYES
    			(stops by the door)
    		What about medical records?  Could
    		you gives us the name of your
    		doctor?  Or your dentist?
    
    				CHANCE
    		I have no need for a doctor or
    		dentist.  I have never been ill.
    
    				HAYES
    			(a smile to Chance)
    		I see...Well, good day, Mr. Chance.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(returns smile)
    		Good day, Sally.
    
    	Chance watches as they leave, then puts Franklin's card
    	on a desk without ever looking at it and turns to stare
    	at television.
    
    20.	INT. TOWNHOUSE - ATTIC - AFTERNOON
    
    	A large attic filled with the Old Man's possessions of
    	the past.  Chance enters, turns on an old black-and white
    	TV with a magnifying lens attached to the front.  As it
    	plays, he selects a fine leather suitcase from several,
    	takes a hand-made suit from a long rack.
    
    21	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
    
    	The TV is on as Chance packs his belongings.  He tries
    	to fit in his umbrella, but it is too long for the suitcase.
    
    22	EXT. GARDEN - AFTERNOON
    
    	Chance, very nicely dressed, with his suitcase and umbrella,
    	stands in the middle of the garden looking around.
    
    23	INT. TOWNHOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - AFTERNOON
    
    	Chance is reluctant to open the front door.  After some
    	hesitation, he gathers up his courage, opens it and steps
    	outside, closing the door behind him.
    
    24	EXT. FRONT OF TOWNHOUSE - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON
    
    	Chance stops short on the steps; the front of the townhouse
    	is run down and the yard filled with trash.  He tries
    	to return to the safety of inside, but the door is locked.
    	Chance stays on the steps for a moment, ponders which way
    	to go.  Making a decision, he steps to the sidewalk and
    	walks down the street to reveal a decaying ghetto.
    	Windows are shattered or boarded up, walls are smeared
    	with grafitti.  Chance passes a group of black people
    	huddled together in threadbare stuffed furniture on the
    	sidewalk, a fire burning between them for warmth.  Chance
    	nods politely to the the people; they stare back, no sign of
    	friendship in their faces.
    
    25	EXT. GHETTO STREET - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON
    
    	Chance walks along a ghetto sidewalk.  He notices some-
    	thing, moves across the street toward a gang of eight
    	to ten hard-core ghetto youths.
    
    26	EXT. GHETTO STREET - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON
    
    	Chance approaches the gang.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(friendly)
    		...Excuse me, would you please
    		tell em where I could find a
    		garden to work in?
    
    	They turn to him as one, silent.  After a moment, LOLO, one
    	of the gang, speaks.
    
    				LOLO
    		What you growin', man?
    
    				CHANCE
    		There is much to be done during
    		the winter, I must start the
    		seeds for the spring, I must
    		work the soil...
    
    	The leader of the gang, ABBAZ, moves forward and interrupts.
    
    				ABBAZ
    		Bullshit.  Who sent you here,
    		boy?  Did that chickenshit
    		asshole Raphael send you here,
    		boy?
    
    				CHANCE
    		No.  Thomas Franklin told me
    		that I had to leave the Old
    		Man's house, he's dead now,
    		you know...
    
    				ABBAZ
    		Dead, my ass!  Now get this,
    		honkie - you go tell Raphael
    		that I ain't takin' no jive
    		from no Western Union messenger!
    		You tell that asshole, if he got
    		somethin' to tell me to get his
    		ass down here himself!
    			(edges closer
    			to Chance)
    		You got that boy?
    
    	During this, as Abbaz becomes more hostile, Chance reaches
    	into his pocket, takes out his remote control TV changer.
    	He points the changer at Abbaz and clicks it three times,
    	tries to change the picture.  ABBAZ immediately pulls out
    	a switchblade knife, holds it at Chance.
    
    				ABBAZ
    		Now, move, honkie!  Before I
    		cut your white ass.
    
    	Chance, disappointed that the changer did not work, returns
    	it to his pocket.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes. I understand.  If I see
    		Raphael, I will tell him.
    			(as he leaves)
    		Good day.
    
    	Abbaz, Lolo and the gang watch him go, then begin to buzz
    	with excitement:  "Who the fuck died?"  "Why'd he pull that
    	changer on us, man?"  "The Old Man died, must be Papa Joe!"
    	"He's some weird honkie, man!"
    
    27	EXT. PORNO AREA - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON
    
    	A street lined with adult book stores, X-rated movies and
    	strip joints.  An elderly Black Woman approaches carrying a
    	bag of groceries.  Chance steps in front of the woman, stops
    	her.
    
    				CHANCE
    		I'm very hungry now.  Would
    		you please bring my lunch?
    
    	The woman looks up to Chance, becomes very frightened.
    	She turns and half-runs into a sleazy bar for safety.
    	Chances watches after her for a moment, then continues
    	along.
    
    28	EXT. PARK - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON
    
    	Chance stands looking through a chain-link fence
    	watching some teenage boys playing basketball.  He bangs
    	on the fence, calls to them.
    
    				CHANCE
    		I have seen your game!  I have
    		watched Elvin Hayes play it
    		many times!  They call him
    		'Big E!'
    
    	The boys ignore him, Chance walks away.
    
    29	EXT. - WASHINGTON, D.C. - LATE AFTERNOON
    
    	Chance seems stumped on which way to walk.  He looks one
    	way, then the other, turns and looks behind him and sees a
    	large statue of Benito Juarez pointing.  Chance smiles and
    	goes off in the direction that Benito points.
    
    30	EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - LATE AFTERNOON
    
    	Chance walks down the center meridian of a divided street.
    	He seems oblivious to the automobiles passing on either
    	side.  In the background can be seen the Capitol Building.
    
    31	EXT. REAR OF THE WHITE HOUSE - DUSK
    
    	Chance is across the street from the White House, inspecting
    	the branches of a potted tree.  He moves to a POLICEMAN
    	standing nearby.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Excuse me...
    			(points to tree)
    		...That tree is very sick.  It
    		should be cared for.
    
    	The Policeman looks at the tree, then at Chance, figures a
    	man dressed that well must be important.
    
    				POLICEMAN
    		Yes sir.  I'll report it right
    		away.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  That would be a good
    		thing to do.  Good day.
    
    				POLICEMAN
    		Good day.
    
    	The Policeman takes out his walkie-talkie as Chance leaves.
    
    32	EXT. BUSINESS DISTRICT - EVENING
    
    	A fashionable area.  Expensive shops, well-kept streets
    	and sidewalks.  Chance stands by the display window of a
    	TV store, looks in at a dozen or so color TVs, all turned
    	on, playing various channels.  A video camera points outward
    	and is focused on the sidewalk to allow passersby to see
    	themselves live on TV.  Chance is intrigued by his own image.
    	He poses, then steps back off the curb, frowns as his like-
    	ness disappears from the frame.  Standing between two parked cars,
    	Chance takes out his remote control, clicks it at the store.
    	Four or five other sets in the window change channels, but
    	he does not reappear on the giant screen.  As he does this,
    	the car to his left, a large, American-made limousine, backs
    	up.  The limo bumps Chance, pins him against the car to his
    	right.  Chance cries out in pain, drops his suitcase, his
    	umbrella, his changer, and bangs his hand on the trunk of the
    	limo.  The chauffer, DAVID, and the liveryman, JEFFREY,
    	immediately jump from the car, run back to Chance.
    
    				DAVID
    		I'm very sorry, sir... I...
    
    	David and Jeffrey reach out to help, but Chance is wedged
    	solidly between the two cars.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(in pain)
    		...I can't move... My leg...
    
    				DAVID
    			(rushes back to limo)
    		...My Lord...
    
    				JEFFREY
    		This is terrible, sir - I hope
    		you're not badly injured...
    
    				CHANCE
    		No.  I'm not badly injured.  But
    		my leg is very sore.
    
    	David pulls the car forward, freeing Chance.  A few by-
    	standers begin to gather as Jeffrey helps Chance to the
    	sidewalk.
    
    				JEFFREY
    		Can you walk?  It's not broken,
    		is it?
    
    				CHANCE
    			(leans against limo,
    			holds leg)
    		I hope not.
    
    				DAVID.
    			(returning)
    		Perhaps I should call an
    		ambulance.
    
    	A BYSTANDER interrupts.
    
    				BYSTANDER
    		Somebody ought to call the police!
    
    				CHANCE
    			(looks over, smiles)
    		There's no need for police, it's
    		just my leg.
    
    	During this, the rear door of the limo opens and EVE RAND
    	steps out.  Eve is in her mid-thirties, and is rich.
    	She is not pleased with this inconvenience
    
    				JEFFREY
    		Let's have a look, do you mind?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Of course.  I would like to look.
    
    	Chance bends, raises his trouser leg.  A red-bluish swollen
    	bruise is forming on his calf.  Eve moves closer, looks at
    	the bruise.
    
    				EVE
    			(to Chance)
    		...Won't you let us do something
    		for you?  Your leg should be
    		examined, we could take you to a
    		hospital.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(smiles at Eve)
    		There's no need for a hospital.
    
    				EVE
    		Why, there certainly is.  You
    		must see a doctor, I insist on
    		it.  Please, let us take you.
    
    	Eve turns to get back in the limo.  David goes with her
    	to hold the door.
    
    				DAVID
    		I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Rand,
    		I never saw the man.
    
    				EVE
    		Oh, I don't think it was anyone's
    		fault, David.
    
    				DAVID
    		Thank you, ma'am.
    
    	Jeffrey holds the door open but Chance is hesitant about
    	getting in the car.
    
    				CHANCE
    		I've never ridden in an auto-
    		mobile.
    
    				JEFFREY
    			(a beat)
    		I assure you, sir, David is a
    		very careful driver.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(looks at the car,
    			then decides)
    		...Yes.  You can take me.
    
    				JEFFREY
    			(as Chance gets in)
    		Very good.
    
    	Jeffrey closes the door, goes back to pick up Chance's
    	suitcase and umbrella but does not notice the remote
    	control.  As Jeffrey puts Chance's bag into the trunk, we
    	see the personalized license plate "Rand 1."
    
    33	INT. LIMOUSINE MOVING THROUGH TOWN - EVENING
    
    	Chance and Eve are settled in the back seat.  As they talk,
    	Chance is experiencing his first ride in a car.
    
    				EVE
    		I hope you're comfortable.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes, I am.
    
    				EVE
    		These situations can be so
    		trying - everybody seems to
    		make such a todo over a
    		simple little accident...
    			(eyes Chance)
    		...the insurance, police, the
    		news and all... Is your leg
    		feeling any better?
    
    				CHANCE
    		No, it isn't.
    
    				EVE
    		I see.
    
    	Chance looks out the window at passing cars.
    
    				CHANCE
    		It looks very much like television
    		but you can see further.
    
    				EVE
    			(not hearing him)
    		Say - if you came to our house,
    		we could take care of you there.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Your house?
    
    				EVE
    		Yes.  My husband has been very
    		ill.  His doctor and nurses are
    		staying with us.  Those hospitals
    		can be so impersonal - why, it
    		might be hours before you are
    		treated...
    
    				CHANCE
    		I agree.
    
    				EVE
    		Fine, it will save a lot of un-
    		necessary fuss and it will be
    		so much more pleasant for you...
    			(leans forward)
    		David, we'll just go on home.
    		Jeffrey, would you call and let
    		them know?
    
    				JEFFREY
    		Yes ma'am.
    
    	Jeffrey closes the glass between them, then dials the
    	limo telephone.
    
    	There is a moment of silence.  Eve, a bit uncomfortable,
    	presses a button.  The limo's bar moves out, revealing a
    	row of decanters and glasses.
    
    				EVE
    		Would you care for a drink?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  Thank you.  I am very
    		thirsty.
    
    	As Eve pours cognac into a monogrammed crystal glass,
    	Chance notices the limo's TV set.
    
    				CHANCE
    		I would like to watch television.
    
    				EVE
    			(a bit surprised)
    		Oh?  Certainly...
    
    	She hands Chance the cognac, turns on the TV.
    
    				EVE
    		May I ask your name?
    
    	Chance takes a sip of the cognac, is not accustomed
    	to alcohol, coughs.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(with a slight cough)
    		My name is Chance.
    
    				EVE
    		Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
    
    				CHANCE
    		No, I'm a gardener.
    
    				EVE
    		Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr.
    		Chauncey Gardiner... You're not
    		related to Basil and Perdita
    		Gardiner are you?
    
    				CHANCE
    		No... I'm not related to
    		Basil and Perdita.
    
    				EVE
    		Oh.  Well, they're just a wonderful
    		couple, we've been friends for
    		years.  We visit their island quite
    		often.
    
    	Chance suddenly starts going through his pockets, searching.
    
    				EVE
    		Did you lose something?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  I lost my remote control.
    
    				EVE
    		Oh...  Well, I'm very sorry...
    
    	Another pause, Chance reaches out, changes channels on TV.
    
    34	EXT. HIGHWAY - WOODED AREA - NIGHT
    
    	The limo approaches, then turns into the entranceway of
    	the Rand Estate.  Two guards stand on either side of the
    	open gate, salute as the car passes through.
    
    35	INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
    
    	As Eve speaks, Chance is glued to the TV, switches
    	channels to the news.
    
    				EVE
    		Is there anything special you
    		like to watch?
    
    				CHANCE
    		I like to watch.  This is fine.
    
    				EVE
    		I know it's very mportant to
    		stay informed of all the
    		latest events, but I find
    		there is so much to assimilate
    		that it can become quite
    		muddling at times...
    
    	Chance nods, changes the channel, watches a Mighty Mouse
    	cartoon.  Eve takes it for a small joke and smiles
    	patronizingly.
    
    36	EXT. RAND MANSION - NIGHT
    
    	At least three uniformed people, two valets, WILSON and
    	PERKINS, and LEWIS, the Doorman, are waiting at the front
    	of the Rand Mansion as the limousine arrives.  There is
    	a general hubbub as the three of them, along with Jeffrey,
    	help Chance into a wheelchair.
    
    37	INT. RAND MANSION - FRONT HALLWAY - NIGHT
    
    	As the group comes through the front doors, Wilson is
    	wheeling Chance.  A uniformed woman, GRETA, is waiting
    	to take Eve's coat.
    
    				EVE
    			(to Wilson)
    		You take Mr. Gardiner to the
    		third floor guest suite.
    
    				EVE
    			(to Chance)
    		I'll see you after Dr. Allenby
    		has a look at your leg.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes, I think he should examine
    		my leg.
    
    	Eve heads off partially revealing a remarkable and large
    	place to live in as Wilson wheels Chance into the elevator.
    
    38	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
    
    	As the door closes on them, Chance looks to Wilson.
    
    				CHANCE
    		...I've never been in one of
    		these.
    
    	Wilson thinks that Chance is talking about the wheelchair.
    
    				WILSON
    		It's one of Mr. Rand's.  Since
    		he's been ill...
    
    				CHANCE
    			(looks around elevator)
    		Does it have a television?
    
    				WILSON
    			(laughs)
    		No - but Mr. Rand does have one
    		with an electric motor, that way
    		he can get around by himself.
    
    				CHANCE
    		I see.
    
    	Chance again checks out the elevator.
    
    				CHANCE
    		How long do we stay in here?
    
    				WILSON
    		How long?  I don't know, see
    		what the doctor says...
    
    	The elevator stops on the third floor.
    
    39	INT. RAND MANSION - PALM COURT - NIGHT
    
    	Eve is talking to ROBERT ALLENBY.  He is in his late
    	fifties and has been Benjamin Rand's doctor for years.
    
    				EVE
    		I pray that I did the right
    		thing, Robert.  I didn't want
    		to take the risk of any
    		publicity, especially with
    		Benjamin being so ill.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		I'm sure you did, EVE.  But
    		let's just hope he's not one
    		of those opportunists that try
    		and make a fortune out of every
    		little bruise.
    
    				EVE
    		Well, I'm sure we could make a
    		settlement if we had to, but
    		I'd rather not - find out what
    		you can, I'm going to change.
    
    				ALLENBY
    			(as she goes)
    		Ben's been asking about you...
    
    				EVE
    			(over her shoulder)
    		I'll see him soon.
    
    	Allenby watches after her for a beat, then turns, goes
    	off in the other direction.
    
    40	INT. GUEST SUITE - NIGHT
    
    	An enormous bedroom, filled with 18th Century antique
    	furniture.  Allenby dabs Chance's ass with a piece of
    	cotton soaked in alcohol, prior to an injection.  Chance
    	stands with his pants to the floor, looks to the tele-
    	vision which is not turned on.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		This will ease the pain and
    		swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
    
    				CHANCE
    		I understand.  I've seen it
    		done before.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		Now, you'll barely feel this.
    		It won't hurt at all.
    
    	Allenby administers the injection, Chance reacts from
    	the pain.
    
    				CHANCE
    		You were wrong, it did hurt.
    
    				ALLENBY
    			(a chuckle)
    		But not for long...
    
    	As Allenby puts a band-aid on Chance's ass, Chance spots
    	a remote control for the TV on the bedside table.  He
    	reaches out, picks it up.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		It's good that there was no
    		apparent damage to the bone.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  I think so, too.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		There could be minor hemorr-
    		haging, which really isn't
    		too serious at the time, but
    		can cause secondary problems
    		if not looked after.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(turns on TV)
    		I see.
    
    				ALLENBY
    			(a look to the TV,
    			then to Chance)
    		You can pull your trousers up,
    		now.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Oh, fine.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		Just to take the proper pre-
    		cautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd
    		recommend we take you down-
    		stairs and X-Ray your leg.
    
    	There is no reaction from Chance, Allenby takes a long
    	look at him.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		...By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I
    		would like to ask you something
    		straight out.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(doesn't understand)
    		...Straight out?
    
    				ALLENBY
    		Yes.  Are you planning on making
    		any sort of claim against the
    		Rand's?
    
    				CHANCE
    			(after a beat)
    		Claim...? ...Oh, claim, that's
    		what Thomas asked me.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		Thomas?  Who's Thomas?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		An attorney?
    
    				CHANCE
    			(turns to TV)
    		Yes.
    
    				ALLENBY
    			(suddenly very cold)
    		Then you wish to handle this
    		matter through your attorneys?
    
    				CHANCE
    		There's no need for a claim,
    		the garden is a healthy one.
    
    				ALLENBY
    			(gives Chance a look)
    		Oh, I see...
    			(laughs)
    		...Well, then...  You caught me
    		off guard, I must admit...
    
    				CHANCE
    			(changes channels,
    			sits on bed)
    		Thank you.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		Good, keep your weight off
    		that leg, Mr. Gardiner.  In
    		fact, it would be best if
    		you could stay here for a
    		day or two, if that would be
    		possible.  I can promise you
    		the finest in care.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes, I could stay here.  Does
    		this house have a garden?
    
    				ALLENBY
    		...Why, yes - many
    
    	Allenby picks up his bag, heads for the door.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		I'll send Wilson up to take you
    		for X-Rays, Mr. Gardiner.  Feel
    		free to use the telphone, and
    		please let me know if you have
    		any discomfort.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(clicking changer)
    		Yes, I will.
    
    	Allenby gives him a look, then leaves.  Chance watches an
    	old movie of a man lighting a cigar.  The man enjoys the
    	cigar, blows out smoke.  The scene seems to 'sink into'
    	Chance's mind.
    
    41	INT. EVE'S BEDROOM/SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
    
    	Allenby enters to reveal Eve standing in front of large
    	double windows that are wide open.  She is wearing different
    	clothes, different hair.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		Good God, Eve - you'll freeze.
    
    				EVE
    		I wanted some fresh air.
    		How is Mr. Gardiner?
    
    				ALLENBY
    		A rather large contusion, but
    		there isn't any...
    
    				EVE
    			(interrupts)
    		That's not what I meant, Robert.
    
    				ALLENBY
    			(a beat)
    		Okay...Well - he seemed to be
    		a most reasonable man, I don't
    		think he'll cause any trouble.
    
    				EVE
    		Thank God for that.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		I'd like to keep an eye on him,
    		though - I suggested that he
    		stay here for a couple of days.
    
    				EVE
    		Stay here?  Is that necessary?
    
    				ALLENBY
    		Not necessary, but preferable.
    		Don't worry, Eve - he might be a
    		breath of fresh air...
    
    				EVE
    			(a beat)
    		...Yes, he is different... He's
    		very intense, and internal, don't
    		you think?
    
    				ALLENBY
    		Perhaps... Actually, I found him
    		to have quite a sense of humor.
    
    				EVE
    		Good.  It might be pleasant for
    		a couple of days....
    
    	Eve is silent for a moment, looks out to the darkness.
    
    				EVE
    		I guess I should go see Ben now.
    			(turns)
    		I'll see you at dinner.
    
    	Eve leaves the room.
    
    44	INT. RAND'S CONVERTED BEDROOM - NIGHT
    
    	Eve enters through heavy glass doors.  BENJAMIN RAND,
    	wearing a silk bathrobe, lies on a king-sized bed to one
    	side of the room.  Rand perks up as sees Eve crossing
    	to him.  He is in his sixties, maintains an inner
    	strength and dignity despite the sapping effects of his
    	illness.
    
    				RAND
    			(with wekness)
    		...Eve...
    
    	Eve kisses him, holds his hand.
    
    				EVE
    			(with conviction)
    		Oh, Ben - I do miss you when
    		I'm out... How are you feeling?
    
    				RAND
    		Tired... And I'm getting tired
    		of being tired.  Other than
    		that, I'm doing very well.
    
    				EVE
    		I'm so glad... No headaches?
    
    				RAND
    		No, it's been a good day - better
    		that yours, from what I've been
    		told.
    
    				EVE
    		You heard?
    
    				RAND
    		I may be a shut-in, but I do not
    		lack for news.  I'm sorry you had
    		to go through all that.
    
    				EVE
    		Oh, it wasn't all that bad darling.
    		We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner
    		turned out to be so reasonable.
    
    				RAND
    		Reasonable?  Good, I'd like to meet
    		a reasonable man.  Why don't you
    		ask this Gardiner to join us for
    		dinner?
    
    				EVE
    		For dinner?  Are you well enough
    		for that?
    
    				RAND
    			(smiles)
    		Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve -
    		if I wait until I feel better,
    		will I ever meet the man?
    			(Eve is silent)
    		Constance!
    
    	CONSTANCE, in a nurse's uniform, appears in a side doorway.
    
    				RAND
    		Constance!  I want new blood
    		tonight, I'm getting up for
    		dinner.
    
    				CONTANCE
    		But, Mr. Rand...
    
    				RAND
    		Don't argue, tell Robert I
    		want new blood!
    			(turns to Eve)
    		...Ask him to dinner.
    
    	Rand pulls Eve's hand close, kisses it.
    
    				EVE
    			(after a beat)
    		... I ran into Senator Jansen at
    		lunch today and he all but ignored
    		me... And it's starting to happen
    		a lot lately... since you've been
    		sick.
    
    				RAND
    		Dammit, there's no excuse for that.
    		I'll call him tomorrow.
    
    				EVE
    		Thank you, darling.
    
    43	INT. RAND MANSION - FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
    
    	The elevator door opens to reveal Wilson with Chance in
    	the wheelchair.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(as Wilson wheels
    			him out)
    		...Thats is a very small room.
    
    				WILSON
    			(laughs)
    		Yes sir, I guess that's true -
    		smallest room in the house.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(glancing around)
    		Yes.  It seems to be.
    
    	Wilson takes this as another joke, chuckles as he wheels
    	Chance toward Rand's hospital room.
    
    44	INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
    
    	A glass-enclosed room, next to Rand's bedroom, filled with
    	the very latest in hospital emergency equipment.  CONSTANCE
    	and another nurse, TERESA, stand by as Rand is being given
    	a transfusion.  Rand lifts his head as Wilson wheels Chance
    	into the room.
    
    				RAND
    		Welcome to Rand Memorial
    		Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(looks around room)
    		...I see.
    
    	Wilson pushes Chance to the X-Ray machine, where BILLINGS, a
    	Black technician helps him onto the table.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(inhales deeply)
    		I feel very good in here.
    
    				RAND
    		That's the oxygen!  When I first
    		got sick I had it all glassed in
    		so I could have a little extra
    		oxygen pumped in, keeps my
    		spirits up.
    
    	Chance is now flat on his back as Billings lines up the
    	X-Ray camera.
    
    				CHANCE
    		You must be very sick.
    
    				RAND
    		Aplastic anemia, Mr. Gardiner -
    		aplastic anemia.  Failure of the
    		bone marrow to produce red blood
    		cells... Not a damn thing they
    		can do about it.  Oh, they can
    		make me comfortable, prolong my
    		life with steroid therapy and
    		transfusions... But what makes
    		my blood boil, what little I
    		have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner
    		- is that it's generally a young
    		person's disease... Here I am,
    		getting on in years and about to
    		die of a young person's disease...
    
    				CHANCE
    			(smiles at Rand)
    		I've never seen anything like this
    		on television.
    
    				BILLINGS
    		Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
    
    				CONSTANCE
    		You too, Mr. Rand, you must stay
    		quiet.
    
    				RAND
    			(lays his head
    			back)
    		..You will join us for dinner,
    		won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  I am very hungry.
    
    				RAND
    		... So am I, my boy - so am I.
    
    	Chance stares at Billings, reacts to him being black.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Do you know Raphael?
    
    				BILLINGS
    		No sir, I don't believe I do.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Oh.  I have a message for him.
    
    				BILLINGS
    		Yes, sir.
    
    				CHANCE
    		A black man gave me the message.
    
    				BILLINGS
    		Well, I still don't believe I
    		know the man, Mr. Gardiner.
    		Now, please hold still.
    
    45	INT. RAND DINING ROOM - NIGHT
    
    	The dining room is immense, a 75-foot ceiling, huge fire-
    	places.  Allenby, Eve, Rand and Chance (both in wheel-
    	chairs) sit around the table.  THURMAND, a waiter, and
    	MARIANNE, a waitress, enter carrying trays of food.  Eve
    	turns to Chance.
    
    				EVE
    		I do hope your injury won't
    		prevent you from attending to
    		business, Mr. Gardiner?
    
    				CHANCE
    		No.  It won't do that.
    
    				EVE
    		...Would you like us to notify
    		anyone for you?
    
    				CHANCE
    		No.  The Old Man died and
    		Louise left.
    
    				EVE
    		Oh.  I'm very sorry.  Well, if
    		you have a need for any of our
    		facilities, please don't hesi-
    		tate to ask.
    
    				RAND
    		Do you need a secretary?
    
    				CHANCE
    		No, thank you.  My house has
    		been closed.
    
    				RAND
    		Oh, you mean to say that your
    		business was shut down.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  Shut down and locked by
    		the attorneys.
    
    				RAND
    		What'd I tell you? ...I know
    		exactly what you mean.  Today
    		the businessman is at the
    		mercy of kid-lawyers from the
    		SEC.  All they want to do is
    		regulate our natural growth!
    
    				ALLENBY
    		It's happening to everyone,
    		I'm afraid.  The way things
    		are going they'll probably
    		legislate the Medical Profession,
    		as we know it, right out of
    		existence.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  Right out of existence.
    
    				RAND
    		And it's a damn shame - it's all
    		happening too fast...
    			(sighs)
    		What are your plans now, Mr.
    		Gardiner?  Or may I call you
    		Chauncey?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  Chauncey is fine.
    
    				RAND
    		And I'm Ben.
    
    				ALLENBY
    			(smiles to Chance)
    		Robert.
    
    				EVE
    			(also smiles)
    		...Eve.
    
    				RAND
    		So tell me, Chauncey, just
    		what are your plans?
    
    				CHANCE
    		I would like to work in your
    		garden.
    
    				EVE
    			(laughs)
    		Oh, I know exactly what you
    		mean.  I sometimes enjoy
    		puttering around myself, such
    		a pleasant way to forget one's
    		troubles.
    
    				RAND
    		I never had a feel for it my-
    		self... But, Eve - why don't
    		you show Chauncey our gardens
    		tomorrow...
    			(to Chance)
    		They're quite lovely.
    
    				EVE
    		Well, it'll have to wait until
    		I get back from Boston...
    		Unfortunately, my morning will
    		be taken up by another one of
    		those charity events.
    
    				CHANCE
    		I am a very good gardener.
    
    				RAND
    		Isn't that what a businessman is?
    		A gardener?  A person that makes
    		flinty soil productive with the
    		labor of his own hands, who waters
    		it with sweat from his own brow,
    		and who creates a place of value for
    		his family and community?  Yes, in-
    		deed, Chauncey, a productive busi-
    		nessman is a laborer in his own
    		vineyard.
    
    				CHANCE
    		I know exactly what you mean, Ben.
    		The garden that I left was such a
    		place.  But I don't have that any
    		more...
    			(points to ceiling)
    		...All that's left for me now is
    		the room upstairs.
    
    				RAND
    		Now, wait a minute, Chauncey - you
    		have your health... for
    		God's sake don't give up on your-
    		self!  You have to fight!
    		You can't let those bastards
    		keep you down!  I don't want
    		to hear any more from you about
    		the 'Room Upstairs.'  That's
    		where I'm going soon.
    
    	There is a long pause.  Chance looks up, then smiles at
    	Rand.
    
    				CHANCE
    		It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
    
    				RAND
    			(laughs)
    		Yes, I'm sure it is.  That's
    		what they say, anyway.
    
    	Another period of silence.  The servants bustle around
    	the room as Allenby studies Chance.
    
    46	INT. RAND'S POOL ROOM - NIGHT
    
    	Allenby is shooting pool.  Rand is offering Chance a cigar
    	from a humidor.
    
    				RAND
    		Have one of these, Chauncey - 
    		they're Cuban.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Thank you, Ben.
    
    	Chance examines the cigar, does not see Rand clip the end
    	off his own.
    
    				RAND
    		It's one thing Robert
    		can't keep me from.  I've
    		enjoyed a cigar as long
    		as I can remember.
    
    	Rand turns the cigar clipper to Chance.  As Chance tries
    	to figure out the clipper, the flame from an ornate lighter
    	catches his eye and Chance watches intently as Rand lights
    	hiw own cigar.
    
    				RAND
    		...You know, Chauncey, there are
    		thousands of American businessmen,
    		large and small, that share your
    		plight.  I've been concerned with
    		the situation for some time now.
    			(hands lighter
    			to Chance)
    		...I'd like to offer the decent
    		'gardeners' of the community a
    		helping hand.  They've been
    		harrassed long enough by inflation,
    		excessive taxation, unions, all
    		sorts of indecencies...
    
    	Allenby watches Chance as he first tries to light the
    	lighter, then tries to light the unclipped cigar.
    
    				RAND (cont'd)
    		After all, they are our strongest
    		defense against the pollutants
    		that threaten our basic freedoms
    		and the well-being of our middle
    		class.  So I've been thinking
    		about beginning a financial
    		assistance fund... Tell me,
    		Chauncey, would you have any
    		thoughts on such a program?
    
    				CHANCE
    			(puffing, trying
    			to light cigar)
    		No, Ben.
    
    				RAND
    			(a smile)
    		Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey?
    		Well, I can understand that.  When
    		a man loses everything, anger has
    		a tendacy to block out reason for
    		a time.  Just give it some thought,
    		work with the idea, I'm sure you'll
    		have plenty to say in a few days.
    
    	Chance puts the unlit cigar in the ashtray, smiles at
    	a most curious Allenby.
    
    47	INT. MANSION - ELEVATOR - NIGHT
    
    	Wilson stands behind Chance in the wheelchair.  Chance
    	glances slowly around the elevator.  Suddenly, Wilson breaks
    	out into laughter.
    
    				WILSON
    		...Sorry, sir... I thought
    		you were going to come out
    		with another one of your
    		jests about the elevator...
    		Excuse me, sir...
    
    	The elevator stops, the door opens.
    
    48	INT. MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
    
    	Wilson wheels Chance out of the elevator.
    
    				CHANCE
    		...Hmmm...  Elevator.
    
    				WILSON
    			(laughs again)
    		...Yes sir - elevator!
    
    	Wilson stops laughing as he notices Eve coming toward them.
    
    				EVE
    		Chauncey, I wanted to tell you
    		how dreadful I feel about your
    		leg, but how delighted I am
    		that you are staying with us.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Thank you, Eve - I like this
    		house very much.
    
    				EVE
    		...And Ben is just mad about
    		you - you've lifted his spirits
    		so - it's just... Well, it's
    		just a real pleasure, your
    		being here...
    
    				CHANCE
    		Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen
    		that before.
    
    				EVE
    		Yes... I know Chauncey.
    
    				CHANCE
    		I like Ben very much... He re-
    		minds me of the Old Man...
    
    				EVE
    		He does...?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  Are you going to leave
    		and close the house when he
    		dies?
    
    	Eve is not prepared for such a question.
    
    				EVE
    		...Why... No, I don't think
    		so...
    
    				CHANCE
    		That's good.
    
    	Chance smiles at Eve and there is a moment of silence
    	before Eve moves away.
    
    				EVE
    		...Good night, Chauncey.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Good night, Eve.
    
    	Wilson wheels Chance toward the guest room.
    
    49	EXT. FRONT OF RAND MANSION - MORNING
    
    	Chance comes out of the front door, walking with a limp
    	for his first view of the Rand grounds.  The attendant,
    	Lewis, hurries to Chance.
    
    				LEWIS
    		Did you want a car, sir?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  I would like a car.
    
    				LEWIS
    		Yes, sir.
    
    	Lewis goes to his post, picks up a phone.  As Chance looks
    	at the surroundings, Allenby and Wilson, with Chance's
    	wheelchair, come out of the house.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		Chauncey, there you are.  What
    		are you doing on that leg?
    
    				CHANCE
    		It's fine today, Robert.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		Shame on you, Chauncey - you
    		should let me be the judge of
    		that.  Please, sit in the chair.
    
    	Wlison pushes a wheelchair to Chance, he sits.
    
    				ALLENBY
    			(checks leg)
    		I swear, Chauncey, between you
    		and Benjamin, I've got my hands
    		full...
    			(examines Chance's
    			calf)
    		...Say, that is coming along, the
    		swelling has gone down considerably...
    
    	A limousine pulls up to the front of the mansion, waits
    	for Chance.
    
    				ALLENBY
    			(continues examining)
    		...Benjamin has been hounding
    		me to allow him to address the
    		annual convention of his
    		Financial Institute today, but
    		obviously, the strain would be
    		impossible... How about here,
    		Chauncey, any soreness?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Hardly any, Robert.
    
    	Lewis, the attendant, interrupts.
    
    				LEWIS
    		Your limousine, sir.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Oh, thank you.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		...Are you going somewhere?
    
    				CHANCE
    		No, Robert.
    
    				ALLENBY
    			(a beat)
    		...Oh... Anyway, the President
    		offered to sit in for Ben at
    		the convention, quite a nice
    		gesture.  He's due here soon,
    		I believe.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes, Robert.  I know about the
    		President.
    
    				ALLENBY
    			(mildly surprised)
    		...Oh?  You've heard?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  Ben called me.  He wants
    		me to meet the President.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		He does, does he?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes, Ben asked me to be in his
    		room at ten o'clock.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
    
    				CHANCE
    		How do I know when it's ten
    		o'clock?
    
    	A long reaction from Allenby, then he looks at his watch.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		...It's five of, you'd best
    		get on in there.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Thank you, Robert.
    
    	Wilson begins to push Chance.
    
    				CHANCE
    		I would like to walk today.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		Hell yes - walk.  You're meeting
    		the President, aren't you?
    
    				CHANCE
    			(gets out of chair)
    		Yes.  I like to watch him on
    		television.
    
    	Allenby, a bit puzzled, watches as Wilson opens the front
    	door for Chance.
    
    50	INT. RAND'S ROOM - MORNING
    
    	Rand is in an easy chair, dressed for his meeting with the
    	President.  The two nurses are nearby.  Rand smiles as
    	Chance is shown into the room by Wilson.
    
    				RAND
    		Chauncey, up and around this
    		morning, are you?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes, Ben.  I like to walk.
    
    				RAND
    		Well, that's good news, my boy.
    
    				CHANCE
    		You're looking much better today,
    		Ben.
    
    				RAND
    		Hah!  It's all makeup, Chauncey...
    		I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up,
    		I didn't want the President to
    		think I was going to die during
    		our talk.
    
    				CHANCE
    		I understand.
    
    				RAND
    		No one likes a dying man, my boy -
    		because few know what death is.
    		All we know is the terror of it.
    		But you're am exception, Chauncey -
    		that's what I admire in you, your
    		marvelous balance.  You don't
    		stagger back and forth between fear
    		and hope - you're a truly peaceful
    		man.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Thank you, Ben.
    			(looks at Rand
    			closely)
    		...Nurse Teresa did a very good
    		job, Ben.
    
    	The nurses turn, look at Chance.
    
    51	INT. RAND MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - MORNING
    
    	Allenby gets off the elevator, stands and thinks for a
    	moment, then heads off down the hallway in the direction
    	of Chance's room.
    
    52	EXT. FRONT RAND MANSION - MORNING
    
    	Perkins is at the head of eight servants lined up on the
    	front steps.  Two black PLYMOUTH SEDANS pull up and EIGHT
    	MEN in grey business suits get out.  One of them, WOLTZ,
    	goes directly to Perkins.
    
    				WOLTZ
    		Good morning, Perkins.
    
    				PERKINS
    		Good morning, Mr. Woltz, nice
    		to see you again.
    
    				WOLTZ
    		Thank you.  How have you been?
    
    				PERKINS
    		Fine, thank you.
    			(hands Woltz paper)
    		We have an additional guest with
    		us today, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
    
    				WOLTZ
    			(reads list)
    		I see...
    			(turns to other men)
    		Okay, let's go to work.
    
    	The eight servants pair up with the eight men in suits
    	and go into the house.
    
    53	INT. RAND'S ROOM - MORNING
    
    	Chance watches television as Rand speaks.
    
    				RAND
    		Yes, when I was younger I had
    		thoughts about public office...
    		But I found, Chauncey -- that I
    		was able to contribute more as
    		a private citizen... Of course,
    		my wealth provided me with con-
    		siderable influence, but I've
    		tried, believe me, not to mis-
    		use that power... It's extremely
    		important, Chauncey, that you
    		don't allow yourself to become
    		blinded to the needs of the
    		country even when the tempations
    		are strong.  I've been labeled a
    		'kingmaker' by many, but I have
    		tried to stay open to the voices
    		of the people... I have tried to
    		remain honest to myself...
    
    				CHANCE
    			(changing channels)
    		...I see, Ben.
    
    54	INT. RAND MANSION - A HALLWAY - MORNING
    
    	One of the servants accompanies Secret Service Agent RIFF
    	as he knocks on each door, checks inside, then moves on.
    
    55	EXT. FRONT RAND MANSION - MORNING
    
    	Lewis picks up his phone and dials as he sees the President's
    	motorcade come through the far gate.
    
    				LEWIS
    			(into phone)
    		The President is arriving now,
    		Mrs. Aubrey.
    
    56	INT. RAND MANSION - MRS. AUBREY'S OFFICE - MORNING
    
    	MRS. AUBREY is Rand's executive secretary, but her office
    	is the Nerve Center of Rand Enterprises.
    
    				MRS. AUBREY
    			(on phone)
    		Very good, Lewis, thank you.
    
    	Mrs. Aubrey clicks off, pushes another button.
    
    57	INT. RAND'S ROOM - MORNING
    
    	Rand smiles at Chance as the phone buzzes.
    
    				RAND
    		He's here.
    			(into phone)
    		Yes, Mrs. Aubrey?
    			(listens)
    		Fine.  Show the President to the
    		library, we'll be along in a few
    		minutes.
    
    	Rand hangs up the phone, turns to Chance with a twinkle
    	in his eyes.
    
    				RAND
    		It's an old habit that goes
    		along with power -- keep them
    		waiting...
    
    	Teresa brings Rand's wheelchair to him.
    
    				RAND
    			(stands, very week)
    		Not now, Teresa.  I'm seeing the
    		President on my own two feet.
    
    				TERESA
    		But, Mr. Rand...
    
    				RAND
    			(puts an arm around
    			Chance for support)
    		Shall we go, Chauncey?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes, Ben.  That's a good idea.
    
    	Rand walks slowly, clings to the limping Chance tightly
    	as they leave the room.
    
    58	EXT. HALLWAY - MORNING
    
    	The President and his entourage are seen on their way to
    	the library as Rand and Chance enter and stop in front
    	of Mrs. Aubrey's office.
    
    				RAND
    		Mrs. Aubrey, have you received
    		the papers on the Caracas
    		agreement?
    
    				MRS. AUBREY
    		Yes, sir.  They're ready for
    		you to sign.
    
    				RAND
    		Excellent.
    			(as they move away)
    		A good woman, Mrs. Aubrey.
    
    				CHANCE
    		I agree, Ben.
    
    	They shuffle off down the hallway and are met immediately
    	by Woltz and and another agent, Barker.  Both carry small metal
    	detectors.
    
    				WOLTZ
    		Good morning, Mr. Rand.
    
    				RAND
    		Woltz...
    			(nods toward Chance)
    		This is Mr. Gardiner.
    
    				WOLTZ
    			(indicates detector)
    		Just a formality, Mr. Gardiner.
    
    	Barker passes the detector over Rand as Woltz checks Chance.
    
    				RAND
    		Good thing we're not in our
    		wheelchairs, you boys would have
    		a devil of a time.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(as Woltz finishes)
    		Thank you very much.
    
    59	INT. RAND LIBRARY - MORNING
    
    	A somewhat nervous PRESIDENT waits for Rand and Chance.
    	When they enter, he goes to Rand with both hands out-
    	stretched.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		Ben!
    
    				RAND
    		...Mr. President, how good to
    		see you.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		It's so good to see you too,
    		Ben, you look terrific!
    
    				RAND
    			(with a look
    			to Chance)
    		Thank you, Mr. President.  Let me
    		tell you, your visit has raised
    		my spirits...
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		Well, I've missed you, my friend.
    			(guides Rand to
    			chair)
    		Here, sit down, get off your
    		feet.
    
    	As Rand sinks into the chair, Chance approaches the President
    	with both hands outstretched.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Good morning, Mr. President.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    			(smiling)
    		...Hello.
    
    				RAND
    		Oh, Mr. President, I'd like you
    		to meet my dear friend, Mr.
    		Chauncey Gardiner.
    
    	Chance and the President exchange a two-handed handshake.
    	The President reacts.
    
    				CHANCE
    		You look much smaller on
    		television, Mr. President.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    			(a beat)
    		...Oh, really...
    
    				RAND
    			(smiling)
    		You will find that Chauncey
    		does not bandy words, Mr.
    		President.
    
    	The President gives Chance a look, then laughs.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's
    		just fine with me - I'm a man
    		that appreciates a frank dis-
    		cussion... Be seated, please,
    		Mr. Gardiner...
    
    				CHANCE
    			(sitting)
    		Yes, I will.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    			(also sits)
    		Now, Ben, did you happen to get
    		a chance to go over...
    
    	Chance reacts to the mention of his name, interrupts.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes?
    
    	There is a beat as the President look at Chance quizzically,
    	then he continues.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		...I just wonder if you had
    		gone over my speech, Ben.
    
    				RAND
    		Yes, I did.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		...Well?
    
    				RAND
    		Overall - pretty good.  But, Mr.
    		President, I think it's very
    		dangerous to resort to temporary
    		measures at this stage of the game.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		Well, Ben... I...
    
    				RAND
    		I sympathize with you and, I
    		know how difficult it is to be
    		straightforward, but I'm telling
    		you right now, Bobby - your
    		position on this is going to
    		cause more dissension that you
    		want or might even be able to
    		stand.
    
    60	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - MORNING
    
    	Allenby is searching through Chance's clothes looking for
    	something.  There is a knock at the door, Allenby pulls
    	back from the closet as Riff opens the door, looks inside.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		Oh... Hello.
    
    				RIFF
    			(entering)
    		Good morning.  I'm Riff, Secret
    		Service.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		...Yes.  Of course.
    
    	Allenby spreads his arms as Riff passes the metal detector
    	over him.
    
    61	INT. LIBRARY - MORNING
    
    	The President paces, is worried about what Rand is telling
    	him.  Chance smiles through it all.
    
    				RAND
    		...There is no longer any margin
    		for inflation, it has gone as
    		far as it can.  You've reached
    		your limits on taxation, dependence
    		on foreign energy is at a point of
    		crisis, and, from where I see it,
    		Mr. President, the so-called Free
    		Enterprise System could be at
    		the breaking point.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		You don't think I should take
    		that chance, huh?
    
    				RAND
    		Absolutely not.
    
    	Chance has reacted to his name, but doesn't know what
    	to say.  The President sits, turns, to Chance.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		Do you agree with Ben, Mr.
    		Gardiner?  Or do you think we
    		can stimulate growth through
    		temporary incentives?
    
    				CHANCE
    			(a beat)
    		As long as the roots are not
    		severed, all is well and all
    		will be well in the garden.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    			(a pause)
    		...In the garden?
    
    				CHANCE
    		That is correct.  In a garden,
    		growth has its season.  There
    		is spring and summer, but there
    		is also fall and winter.  And
    		then spring and summer again...
    
    				PRESIDENT
    			(staring at Chance)
    		...Spring and summer...
    			(confused)
    		Yes, I see...Fall and winter.
    			(smiles at Chance)
    		Yes, indeed.
    
    				RAND
    			(interrupts)
    		I think what my most insightfult
    		friend is building up to, Mr.
    		President, is that we welcome the
    		inevitable saesons of nature, yet
    		we are upset by the seasons of
    		our economy.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  That is correct.  There will
    		be growth in the spring.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    			(pleased)
    		...Well, Mr. Gardiner, I must
    		admit, that is one of the most
    		refreshing and optimistic state-
    		ments I've heard in a very, very
    		long time.
    			(he rises)
    		...I envy your good, solid sense,
    		Mr. Gardiner - that is precisely
    		what we lack on Capitol Hill.
    			(glances at watch)
    		I must be going.
    			(holds out hand
    			to Chance)
    		... This visit has been most
    		enlightening...
    
    	Chance rises and shakes the President's hand.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  It has.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		...You will honor me and my family
    		with a visit, won't you?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  I will.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		Wonderful, we'll all look forward
    		to seeing you.
    			(turns to Rand)
    		Is Eve around?  I'd like to say
    		hello.
    
    				RAND
    		No, she flew up to Boston for some
    		charity event.  She'll be sorry
    		to have missed you.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		I'm sorry, too.  Well, Nancy wanted
    		me to send along her best to the two
    		of you - and, Ben, I want to thank
    		you for your time and thoughts.
    
    				RAND
    		Nonsense, Mr. President - I
    		thank you for coming to spend
    		time with a dying man.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		Now, Ben, I won't have any any of
    		that.  Why don't you listen to
    		your good friend Chauncey -
    		this is a time to think of
    		life!
    
    	The President claps Rand's hand.
    
    				RAND
    		You're right, Mr. President -
    		I don't like feeling sorry
    		for myself.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		Take care of yourself, Ben.
    
    				RAND
    		You too, Bobby.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    			(as he turns to
    			go, a smile to
    			Chance)
    		...Chauncey...
    
    				CHANCE
    		...Bobby...
    
    	The President leaves the library and Chance turns to Rand.
    
    				RAND
    			(as the door
    			closes)
    		He's a decent fellow, the
    		President, isn't he?
    
    				CHANCE
    		I'm glad he came, Ben.  It was
    		nice talking to the President.
    
    62	INT. RAND MANSION - HALLWAY - MORNING
    
    	The President and his entourage are moving along toward
    	the front door.  One aide, KAUFMAN, walks next to the
    	President.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		Kaufman, I'm going to need
    		information on Mr. Chauncey
    		Gardiner's background.
    
    				KAUFMAN
    			(makes note of name)
    		Gardiner, yes, sir.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		And I'd like it some time today.
    
    				KAUFMAN
    		No problem, Chief.
    
    63	INT. RAND MANSION - TAPESTRY ROOM - MORNING
    
    	Rand has an arm around Chance as the two of them walk.
    	Behind them, Wilson and Perkins push empty wheelchairs.
    
    				RAND
    			(very weak)
    		...You know, Chauncey, there's
    		something about you... You don't
    		play games with words to protect
    		yourself.  You're direct...
    			(they walk a
    			few more feet
    			in silence)
    		You know what I was talking to
    		you about last night?
    
    				CHANCE
    			(blankly)
    		No, Ben.
    
    				RAND
    		Oh, sure you do, the financial
    		assistance program for the
    		businessman.
    			(another beat)
    		Well, I think you might be just
    		the man to take charge of such an
    		undertaking.  I'd like you to meet
    		with the other members of the Board
    		so you can discuss the matter at
    		greater length with them.
    
    				CHANCE
    		I understand.
    
    				RAND
    		And, please, Chauncey - don't
    		rush your decision.  I know
    		you're not a man to act on the
    		spur of the moment.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Thank you, Ben.
    
    				RAND
    		And now, Chauncey, I'm afriad
    		you must excuse me - I'm very
    		tired...
    
    	Rand sits down in his wheelchair and Perkins starts off
    	with him.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(as they go)
    		I'm sorry that you are so sick,
    		Ben.
    
    	Chance watches after them for a moment, then his interest
    	is taken by one of the large tapestries.
    
    64	EXT. RAND MANSION - MAIN GARDEN - DAY
    
    	Chance and Eve walk through the garden.  At one end, is a
    	huge Victorian greenhouse, with smaller greenhouses next
    	to it.  Off to one side, stands an attractive stone house.
    	Five young men work in one area, shovelling mulch.
    
    				EVE
    		There are over sixty thousand
    		tulip bulbs planted here.  It's
    		quite a sight when they're
    		blooming.  Of course, the
    		roses are beautiful, too.  We
    		have, I think, around twenty
    		thousand bushes.
    			(gestures to
    			men working)
    		...We plant something different
    		every year in that area... But
    		I haven't decided what I would
    		like this spring.  What do you
    		think, Chauncey?
    
    				CHANCE
    		I don't know.
    
    				EVE
    		Well, give it some thought.
    			(indicates stone
    			house)
    		That's the gardener's house
    		over there.
    
    	Chance looks off to the two story stone house.
    
    65	INT. A GREENHOUSE - DAY
    
    	Chance and Eve are in the middle of a huge potting green-
    	house where hundreds of young plants are tended by four
    	workers.
    
    				CHANCE
    		I like to watch the young
    		plants grow.
    
    				EVE
    		It is wonderful, isn't it?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Young plants do much better
    		if a person helps them.
    
    	Eve looks at Chance as he inspects some of the flowers.
    	She has decided to make a move.
    
    				EVE
    		...Ben tells me the President
    		was very taken with you this
    		morning.
    
    	Chance doesn't know what to say, continues inspecting the
    	flowers.
    
    66	INT. VICTORIAN GREENHOUSE - DAY
    
    	Chance and Eve move through a large and an extra lush green-
    	house until they reach a long room filled with cacti.
    
    				EVE
    			(as they move)
    		...Chauncey...Last night you
    		mentioned an old man, that died.
    		Was a relative?  Or an
    		intimate friend?
    
    				CHANCE
    			(looking at
    			greenhouse)
    		He was a very wealthy man, he
    		looked after me since I was
    		young.
    
    				EVE
    		Oh, I see... Your mentor.
    
    				CHANCE
    		...Mentor...?
    
    	Eve takes his uncertainty as a reluctance to discuss the
    	Old Man.
    
    				EVE
    		Forgive me, Chauncey - I don't
    		mean to pry.  You must have
    		been very close to him.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  I was.
    
    				EVE
    		I'm sorry...
    			(getting more
    			to the point)
    		...And what about Louise?  You
    		mentioned that she had gone.
    		Were you close to her also?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  I liked Louise very
    		much.  She was his maid.
    
    				EVE
    			(relieved)
    		Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I
    		thought perhaps she was someone
    		that you may have been romantically
    		involved with, or maybe your sister.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Oh no.  She brought me my meals.
    
    				EVE
    			(pleased)
    		Of course.
    
    	Eve edges slightly closer to Chance.  Chance edges
    	slightly closer to the cacti, is fascinated by it.
    
    67	INT. RAND'S ROOM - DAY
    
    	Rand is in bed, looking bad.  Eve, Chance and Allenby are
    	seated around him, the two nurses stand to one side.  They
    	all watch the President's address to the Financial Institute
    	on TV.
    
    				PRESIDENT'S VOICE
    		...I know that many of you believe
    		that we are on the brink of the
    		worst financial crisis in this
    		nation's history.  And there are
    		some of you who would like to see
    		us put mandatory freezes on prices
    		and wages, and then call it a
    		temporary measure.  Well, that's
    		exactly what I was going to do
    		until this moment.  But I have
    		decided there are no temporary
    		stop gaps.  So I am going to re-
    		think my position and find
    		another solution.  And, you'll be
    		very pleased to know that your
    		founder and chairman-of-the-board,
    		Mr. Benjamin Turnbull Rand, agrees
    		with me on this...
    			(a beat)
    		...for once.
    
    	There is applause and laughter from the audience.
    
    				PRESIDENT'S VOICE (Cont'd)
    			(after applause)
    		Chauncey Gardiner, Mr. Rand's close
    		friend and advisor, was at our
    		meeting this morning.  I found Mr.
    		Gardiner to have a feeling for
    		this country that we need more of.
    		He likened us to a garden...
    		...To quote Mr. Gardiner, a most
    		intuitive man, 'As long as the
    		roots of industry remain firmly
    		planted in the national soil,
    		the economic prospects are un-
    		doubtedly sunny.'
    
    	Rand starts coughing, breathing heavily.  Allenby and
    	the nurses rush to his bedside.  Allenby shoots a quick
    	look to Eve and Chance.
    
    				ALLENBY
    			(motioning toward door)
    		I think you should leave.
    
    	Eve and an interested Chance leave the room as Allenby
    	administers aid to Rand.
    
    				PRESIDENT'S VOICE (Cont'd)
    		Gentlemen, let us not fear the
    		inevitable chill and storms of
    		autumn and winter, instead, let
    		us anticipate the rapid growth
    		of springtime, let us await the
    		rewards of summer.  As in a
    		garden of the earth, let us
    		learn to accept and appreciate
    		the times when the trees are
    		bare as well as the times when
    		we pick the fruit.
    
    68	INT. RAND MANSION - HALLWAY - DAY
    
    	Eve and Chance stand in silence near the palm court.  Eve's
    	eyes are swollen, red, she has been crying.  She turns to
    	Chance, reaches out, touches his hand.
    
    				EVE
    			(hesitates)
    		...I'm...
    			(pause)
    		...I'm very grateful that you're
    		here, Chauncey...
    			(pause)
    		...With us...
    
    				CHANCE
    		So am I, Eve.
    
    	Allenby comes out of Rand's room, his mood is serious.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		...This has been an exhausting
    		day for Ben... He's resting
    		comfortably now.  There's no
    		cause for alarm...
    
    	Mrs. Aubrey approaches.
    
    				MRS. AUBREY
    		Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone
    		call for you, Sidney Courtney.
    
    				CHANCE
    		...Telephone call?
    
    				MRS. AUBREY
    		Yes, Sidney Courtney, the
    		Financial Editor of the
    		"Washington Post."
    
    	Chance does not react.
    
    				MRS. AUBREY
    			(after a moment)
    		Would you care to take it, sir?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.
    
    	Chance still does not move.  Eve mistakes this for
    	concern for herself.
    
    				EVE
    		I'll be all right, Chauncey -
    		you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes, Eve.  You'll be all right.
    
    	Chance follows Mrs. Aubrey.  Eve watches Chance go, then
    	turns to Allenby.
    
    				EVE
    		...He's such a sensitive man,
    		so considerate...
    
    69	INT. MRS. AUBREY'S OFFICE - DAY
    
    	Three television sets are on.  Mrs. Aubrey hands a phone
    	to Chance, he looks at it, uncertain.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(after a moment, into
    			phone)
    		...Hello.
    
    70	INT. WASHINGTON POST - COURTNEY'S OFFICE - DAY
    
    	SID COURTNEY, a man in his fifties, wears a rumpled wool
    	jacket, smokes a pipe.
    
    				COURTNEY
    		Hello, Mr. Gardiner.  I'm sorry
    		to disturb you, but I watched
    		the President's speech at the
    		Financial Institute today, and
    		I wondered if you have any
    		comments on the meeting that
    		took place between Mr. Rand,
    		the President and yourself.
    
    71	INTERCUT - MRS. AUBREY'S OFFICE/COURTNEY'S OFFICE - DAY
    
    				CHANCE
    		The President is a nice person.
    		I enjoyed it very much.
    
    				COURTNEY
    		Good, sir.  And so, it seems,
    		did the President - but we would
    		like to have some facts; such as,
    		uh... What exactly is the
    		relationship between yourself and
    		that of the First American
    		Financial Corporation?
    
    				CHANCE
    		I think you should ask Mr. Rand
    		that.
    
    				COURTNEY
    		Of course.  But since he is ill
    		I'm taking the liberty of asking
    		you.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(watching three
    			TV sets)
    		Yes, that is correct.  I think
    		you should ask Mr. Rand that.
    
    	Courtney doesn't understand but continues his questioning.
    
    				COURTNEY
    		I see.  Then one more quick
    		question, Mr. Gardiner.
    
    	Chance hangs up the phone, watches the TVs.
    
    	Courtney listens to the dial tone, then puts the receiver
    	down.
    
    				COURTNEY
    			(to himself)
    		No wonder he's so close to
    		Rand...
    
    72	INT. MRS. AUBREY'S OFFICE - DAY
    
    	Mrs. Aubrey puts a call on hold, speaks to Chance who
    	is still intrigued by the three televisions.
    
    				MRS. AUBREY
    		Mr. Gardiner, I have the producer
    		of the 'Gary Burns Show' on the
    		line.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes, I have watched that on
    		television.
    
    				MRS. AUBREY
    		Of course.  They would like you
    		to appear on the show tonight.
    		The Vice-President was scheduled,
    		but he had to cancel, and they
    		asked if you would be interested.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  I would like to be on
    		television.
    
    				MRS. AUBREY
    		Fine.
    
    	Chance turns back to the televisions.  Mrs. Aubrey talks
    	to the producer.
    
    				MRS. AUBREY
    			(into phone)
    		Hello, Mr. Hull... Mr. Gardiner
    		has agreed to do the show... Yes,
    		I'll tell him.  The show will be
    		taped and then shown at ten o'clock,
    		but he's to be there at seven.
    
    73	INT. EVE'S BEDROOM - EVENING
    
    	Eve is on the phone while being attended to by a MANICURIST
    	and a HAIRDRESSER.  Eve talks to Sophie as if they weren't
    	there as one wig is taken off, another is put on.
    
    				EVE
    			(into phone)
    		...Are you kidding?  Of course,
    		I'll bring him, I promise - but
    		I'll get Ben to suggest it...
    		Hands off, Sophie - this one's
    		mine... No, I haven't done that,
    		but give me time... Yes, be sure
    		and watch the 'Burns' Show to-
    		night, you'll see what I mean...
    		Ben?  Oh, he's okay - he's got
    		his ups and downs...
    
    74	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - EVENING
    
    	Chance wears a velvet bathrobe, watches TV.  Wilson and
    	Perkins lay out a suit, shirt, tie, etc.  There is a KNOCK
    	at the door.
    
    				PERKINS
    		Excuse me, sir.
    
    	Perkins answers the door, it is Eve.
    
    				EVE
    			(entering)
    		Chauncey, I wanted to wish you
    		well.  I know you'll be just
    		smashing.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(rising)
    		Thank you, Eve.
    
    				EVE
    		And Benjamin sends along his
    		best wishes.
    
    				CHANCE
    		How is Ben feeling?
    
    				EVE
    		He's tired, Chauncey - but he's
    		going to watch you tonight.
    		We'll both be watching.
    
    				CHANCE
    		That's good.  I like to watch,
    		too.
    
    				EVE
    		I know you do - you and your
    		television...
    			(a pause)
    		...Good luck, Chauncey.
    
    	Eve impulsively steps forward, kisses Chance on the cheek.
    	Chance smiles at her.  Eve returns the smile, then leaves
    	the room.  Chance sits back down, watches TV as Wilson
    	and Perkins attend to his clothes with a whiskbroom.
    
    75	INT. WASHINGTON POST - RESEARCH ROOM - NIGHT
    
    	A woman, KINNEY, sits behind a stack of paperwork.  She
    	has a downcast expression as Sidney Courtney, followed by
    	three staffers, enters the room.
    
    				COURTNEY
    			(to Staffers)
    		...Gardiner is laconic, matter-
    		of-fact.  The scuttlebutt is
    		that he's a strong candidate
    		for one of the seats on the
    		Board of First American.
    			(to Kinney)
    		...Kinney, what did you come up
    		with on his background?
    
    				KINNEY
    			(after pause)
    		...Nothing.
    
    				COURTNEY
    		...Skip the levity, Kinney -
    		what have you got?
    
    				KINNEY
    			(another pause)
    		...I realize this sounds banal -
    		but there is no information of
    		any sort on Gardiner.  We have
    		no material on him - zilch...
    
    	The room is quiet.
    
    76	INT. TV STATION - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
    
    	Chance is intrigued by the the surroundings as MORTON HULL
    	guides him through the corridor.
    
    				HULL
    		Of course, Mr. Gardiner, your
    		position in the financial
    		community carries a lot of
    		weight, but what caught Gary's
    		attention was your down-to-
    		earth philosophy.
    
    				CHANCE
    		I see.
    
    	They walk a while through the corridor.
    
    				HULL
    			(making conversation)
    		Do you realize that more people
    		will be watching you tonight
    		that all those who have seen
    		theater plays in the last
    		forty years?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  It's a very good show.
    
    	Hull takes Chance into the makeup room.
    
    77	EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT
    
    	AIR FORCE 1 taxies to the ground.
    
    78	INT. AIR FORCE 1 - NIGHT
    
    	The President sits on a couch in one of the compartments
    	on the jet.  With him are six of his STAFF, Kaufman
    	included.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		What do you mean, no background?
    		That's impossible, he's a very
    		well known man!
    
    				KAUFMAN
    		Yes, sir - we are aware of all
    		that, but still, we haven't been
    		able to...
    
    				PRESIDENT
    			(interrupts)
    		He's an advisor and close personal
    		friend of Rand's!  For Christ
    		sakes, they have volumes of data
    		on Benjamin!
    
    				KAUFMAN
    		Yes, Mr. President, I plan on
    		contacting Mr. Rand as soon as...
    
    				PRESIDENT
    			(again interrupts)
    		I do not want Benjamin Rand
    		disturbed!  You have other ways
    		of gathering information than to
    		trouble a dying man.  Use whatever
    		agencies are necessary to put to-
    		gether a detailed history of
    		Chauncey Gardiner, if you run
    		into problems, alert Honeycutt.
    			(he stands)
    		Have it in my office at seven
    		in the morning.
    			(he starts for door)
    		I've got to take a leak.
    
    				KAUFMAN
    		Right, chief.
    
    	As the President goes to the Men's Room, two of the aides
    	reach for telephones.
    
    79	INT. TV STATION - CORRIDOR/MAKEUP ROOM - NIGHT
    
    	A PAGE comes through the corridor carrying a glass of
    	water.  He turns into the makeup room to reveal Hull
    	sitting next to Chance in front of the mirror.  The
    	makeup man, COLSON, works on Chance as he watches the
    	guest preceding him on a TV monitor that is reflected
    	in the mirror.
    
    				PAGE
    			(gives Chance water)
    		I thought you might need this
    		about now, Mr. Gardiner.  It
    		gets real hot under these lights.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Thank you.  I am very thirsty.
    
    	The Page leans against the door jamb, smiles if anyone
    	looks at him.
    
    				HULL
    			(briefing Chance)
    		Now, if Gary wants to interrupt
    		you, or ask you a question,
    		he'll raise his left forefinger
    		to his left eyebrow.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(to Colson)
    		Nurse Teresa did Ben's makeup.
    
    				COLSON
    			(laughs)
    		Oh?  Did she do a good job?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes, very good.
    
    	On the TV, GARY BURNS finishes with his guest and the
    	band goes into a hot instrumental number.
    
    				COLSON
    			(a last minute dab)
    		Okay, Mr. Gardiner, looks like
    		you're up.
    
    	Hull leads Chance out of the makeup room.  Colson sits
    	and watches the TV monitor.  The Page, his back to Colson,
    	carefully picks up Chance's water glass so as not to smear
    	the fingerprints, then leaves the room.  On the TV monitor,
    	the band plays, the audience applauds as Burns introduces
    	Chance.
    
    80	INT. RAND LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
    
    				BURNS (on TV)
    		I always find it surprising, Mr.
    		Gardiner, to find men like your-
    		self, who work so intimately with
    		the President, yet manage to remain
    		relatively unknown.
    
    				CHANCE (on TV)
    		Yes.  That is surprising.
    
    				BURNS (on TV)
    		...Well, your anonymity will be
    		a thing of the past from now on.
    
    				CHANCE (on TV)
    			(doesn't understand)
    		I hope so.
    
    				BURNS (on TV)
    			(a beat)
    		Yes...of course.  Well, I assume,
    		since the President quoted you, that
    		you agree with his view of the
    		economy.
    
    				CHANCE (on TV)
    		Which view?
    
    	Applause and laughter from the TV audience.
    
    81	INT. ALLENBY'S ROOM - NIGHT
    
    	Allenby watches, concerned as to which way it will go.
    
    				BURNS (on TV)
    			(a beat)
    		Well, the President compared the
    		economy of this country to a
    		garden, and stated that after a
    		period of decline a time of
    		growth would naturally follow.
    
    				CHANCE (on TV)
    		Yes, I know the garden very well.
    		I have worked in it all my life.
    		It is a good garden and a healthy
    		one;
    
    82	INT. RAND'S ROOM - NIGHT
    
    	Rand is in bed.  Eve sits in a chair next to the bed,
    	squeezes Rand's hand in the excitement as they both watch
    	Chance on television.  Teresa and Constance watch in
    	the Background.
    
    				CHANCE (on TV - cont'd)
    		its tress are healthy and so are
    		its shrubs and flowers, as long as
    		they are trimmed and watered in the
    		right seasons.  The garden needs
    		a lot of care.  I do agree with
    		the President; everything
    		will grow strong, and there is
    		plenty of room in it for new trees
    		and new flowers of all kinds.
    
    	The TV audience applauds Chance and Constance quietly
    	leaves the room.
    
    83	INT. WHITE HOUSE - PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
    
    	The President and First Lady are in bed together watching
    	the show.
    
    				BURNS (on TV)
    		So you're saying, Mr. Gardiner,
    		if the Stock Market collapses,
    		and unemployment keeps increasing.
    		that this is just another season,
    		so to speak, in the garden?
    
    	The First Lady cuddles up to the President.
    
    84	INT. RAND LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
    
    	Chance continues to watch himself.
    
    				CHANCE (on TV)
    		Yes.  In a garden, things grow - but
    		first some things must wither; some
    		trees lose their leaves before they
    		grow new leaves...
    
    85	INT. THOMAS FRANKLIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
    
    	Franklin, the attorney that evicted Chance, comes out of
    	the bathroom brushing his teeth.  His wife, JOHANNA, is
    	in the bed absorbed in the show.  Franklin sits on the end
    	of the bed.
    
    				CHANCE (on TV - cont'd)
    		...And if you give your garden a
    		lot of love, and if you work very
    		hard and have a lot of patience,
    		in the proper season you will see
    		it grow to be very beautiful...
    
    	More applause from the TV.  Franklin leans closer to
    	the set.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    			(puzzled)
    		It's that gardener!
    
    				JOHANNA
    		Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		No!  He's a real gardener!
    
    				JOHANNA
    			(laughs)
    		He does talk like on, but I
    		think he's brilliant.
    
    				BURNS (on TV)
    		Well, that's very interesting,
    		Mr. Gardiner, but, what about
    		the bad seasons?
    
    86	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - NIGHT
    
    	Constance is in Chance's closet searching through his
    	clothing.  Finding nothing, she checks the labels on
    	his suits, copies them in a notepad.
    
    				BURNS (Cont'd)
    			(on TV)
    		Such as prolonged droughts that
    		have wiped out crops, disastrous
    		winters, hurricanes?  Doesn't a
    		country need to have someone in
    		charge that can see it through
    		such crises?  Don't we need a
    		leader capable of guiding us
    		through the bad seasons as well
    		as the good?
    
    				CHANCE
    			(on TV)
    		Yes.  We need a very good gardner.
    
    	Constance continues her work in the closet.
    
    87	INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROROM - NIGHT
    
    	The President and First Lady are very attentive.
    
    				BURNS
    			(on TV)
    		I realize this might be a difficult
    		question for you, Mr. Gardiner -
    		but there are a lot of us around
    		the country that would like to hear
    		your thoughts on the matter.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(on TV)
    		I understand.
    
    				BURNS
    			(on TV)
    		Do you feel that we have a 'very
    		good gardener' in office at this
    		time, Mr. Gardiner?
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		...That bastard...
    
    				CHANCE
    			(on TV)
    		Oh, yes.  It is possible for one
    		side of the garden to be flooded,
    		and the other side to be dry...
    		Some plants do well in the sun,
    		and others grow better in the cool
    		of the shade.
    
    	The First Lady moves closer to the President.
    
    88	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
    
    	A group of ELDERLY BLACK PEOPLE sit in the lobby, watching
    	the show on an old black-and-white TV
    
    				CHANCE (on TV - cont'd)
    		..It is the gardner's responsibility
    		to take water from the flooded area
    		and run it to the area that is dry.
    		It is also the gardner's responsi-
    		bility not to plant a sun-loving flower
    		in the shade of a high wall...
    
    	During the preceding speech, Louise, the maid from the Old
    	Man's house, chatters.
    
    				LOUISE
    		Gobbledegook!  All the time he
    		talked gobbledegook!  An' it's
    		for sure a White man's world in
    		America, hell, I raised that boy
    		since he was the size of a pissant
    		an' I'll say right now he never
    		learned to read an' write - no sir!
    		Had no brains at all, was stuffed
    		with rice puddin' between the ears!
    		Short-changed by the Lord and dumb
    		as a jackass an' look at him now!
    		Yes, sir - all you gotta be is
    		white in America an' you get whatever
    		you want!  Just listen to that boy -
    		gobbledegook!
    
    	There is a chorus of "Amens" as she finishes.
    
    89	INT. RAND LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
    
    	Chance watches himself.
    
    				CHANCE (on TV - cont'd)
    		...It is the responsibility of
    		the gardner to adjust to the bad
    		seasons as well as enjoy the good
    		ones.
    
    	Chance changes channels to a Game Show.
    
    90	INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
    
    	The President and First Lady still watch Chance.
    
    				CHANCE (on TV - cont'd)
    		If the gardner does his job,
    		everything will be fine.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		Oh, Jesus...
    
    	Audience applause is heard on TV.
    
    				BURNS (on TV)
    		Before we take a break...
    		What sort of gardner would
    		you be?
    
    				CHANCE (on TV)
    			(with confidence)
    		I am a very serious gardner.
    
    				BURNS (on TV)
    		I'm sure you are, Mr. Gardiner.
    			(looks at camera)
    		We'll be right back.
    
    	As a commercial comes on, the President rolls over in bed.
    	The First Lady reaches out, puts a comforting hand on his
    	shoulder.
    
    91	INT. RAND'S ROOM - NIGHT
    
    	The commercial is on TV.
    
    				RAND
    		He's a remarkable man, remarkable...
    			(to Eve)
    		You're fond of him too, aren't
    		you, Eve?
    
    				EVE
    			(a beat)
    		...Yes, I am, Ben.
    
    				RAND
    		That's good... that's good.
    
    	Rand looks up as Constance comes back into the room.
    
    				RAND
    		Constance!  Where have you been?
    		You missed the whole show - Chauncey
    		was wonderful.
    
    92	INT. FRANKLIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
    
    	Franklin shuts off the commercial on TV, is talking on
    	the phone.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		Okay, Sally, I'll see you in
    		twenty minutes.
    
    	Franklin hangs up the phone, scurries around getting
    	dressed.  His wife, Johanna, sits grimly in bed.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    			(notices her look)
    		I won't be long, I've just got
    		to talk to her about this Gardiner...
    
    				JOHANNA
    			(turns over in bed)
    		Good night.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		Look, Johanna...
    
    				JOHANNA
    			(cuts him off)
    		I said good night!
    
    	Franklin gives up, hurries from the room.
    
    93	EXT. RAND MANSION - NIGHT
    
    	Some of the household staff are lined up applauding
    	Chance as he steps from the limousine.  Perkins and
    	Wilson come forward.
    
    				WILSON
    		Bravo, sir!  You were outstanding.
    		Outstanding!
    
    				PERKINS
    		May I take your coat, Mr. Gardiner?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  Thank you, Perkins.
    
    	Perkins nods, takes Chance's overcoat, allows everyone
    	to enter the house.  Once alone, Perkins quickly searches
    	through the coatpockets, finds nothing.
    
    94	INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
    
    	The First Lady is snuggled up close to the President,
    	caresses his body.  After a moment, it becomes clear
    	to her that he is not up to the occasion.
    
    				FIRST LADY
    		...Darling...  What's wrong?
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		...I can't... I just can't right
    		now... I'm sorry, dearest... I
    		just can't...
    
    	The First Lady looks at him for a beat, then turns, lies
    	on her back and stares at the ceiling.
    
    95	INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
    
    	Rand is in his wheelchair, stripped to the waist.  Eve
    	stands nearby.  Chance breathes deeply, enjoys the oxygen.
    	Allenby and the nurses prepare four separate injections
    	for Rand, which Allenby administers to him during the
    	scene.
    
    				RAND
    			(with some effort)
    		Senator Rowley's widow is hosting
    		a reception tomorrow night honoring
    		the Soviet Ambasador and I think
    		it's rather obvious that Robert
    		won't allow me to attend.  So,
    		Chauncey, you would be doing me a
    		great favor if you would escort
    		Eve, and go in my place.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  I would like to escort Eve.
    
    				RAND
    		Good.  Together, the two of you
    		should create quite a stir - I can
    		already hear the gossip.
    
    				EVE
    		...Ben, really...
    
    				RAND
    		...You possess a great gift, Chauncey,
    		of  being natural.  And that, my boy,
    		is a rare talent - tonight on television,
    		you were strong and brave and didn't
    		moralize.  I hope the entire country
    		was watching - the entire country.
    
    	Allenby gives Rand the last injection.
    
    96	INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT

    	table, drinks in front of them.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		...It didn't make any sense to
    		me at all.  I didn't know what
    		the hell he was talking about...
    
    				SALLY
    		It wasn't meant for
    		us, Tom - he was talking to the
    		masses.  He was very clever,
    		keeping it at a third grade
    		level - that's what they under-
    		stand...
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		Yeah?  Well, I don't understand why
    		he was in Jennings' house?  What was
    		up his sleeve when he pulled that stunt
    		with us?  What was he doing?  And why?
    
    				SALLY
    		Who knows..?  Maybe the government
    		had something to do with it.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		You know, Sally - he made a
    		fool out of me, ...and you know
    		what that means, don't you?...
    		It means that any political future
    		I had is right down the toilet!
    
    	The CAMERA begins to slowly move away from the table,
    	the sound of Franklin's voice continues.
    
    				FRANKLIN (cont'd)
    		...Jesus, the thought of spending
    		the rest of my life as an attorney,
    		that is really a downer...  And,
    		Christ, Sally, I almost forgot -
    		Johanna is starting to think some-
    		thing's going on between...
    
    	Franklin's voice fades into the background hubbub.  The
    	voice of Kinney, the research assistant from the WASHINGTON
    	POST is heard as the camera settles on a table occupied
    	by Sidney Courtney and his staff.
    
    				KINNEY
    		...Sid, be reasonable - I've been
    		everywhere, there's no place left
    		to check!
    
    				COURTNEY
    		Try again.
    
    				KINNEY
    		Sure, try again - where?  There's
    		nothing, it's like Gardiner never
    		existed!
    
    				COURTNEY
    		Try again.
    
    				KINNEY
    		It's useless!
    
    				COURTNEY
    			(coldly)
    		I said - try again.
    
    	Kinney stands, shoves her paperwork across the table.
    
    				KINNEY
    		Up yours, Sid.  You try again,
    		I quit!
    
    	Kinney takes her drink with her as she leaves the lounge.

    				CHANCE
    		No, thank you.
    
    				EVE
    		...  Well, we can fix up one
    		of Ben's for you tomorrow.
    		Sophie insists on Black Tie.
    
    				CHANCE
    		I see.
    
    	They walk in silence for a moment.  Eve stops, then
    	Chance.
    
    				EVE
    			(softly)
    		...I have very few friends,
    		Chauncey... And Benjamin's
    		friends are all quite a bit
    		older...
    
    	Eve gives Chance a long look, then kisses him on the

    				EVE
    		...Good night, Chauncey.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Good night, Eve.

    				KAUFMAN

    				PRESIDENT
    		What the hell are you talking

    				KAUFMAN
    		Well, we do have some data from the

    				CHANCE
    			(a bite of toast)
    		No, Eve.  I like you to be here.
    
    	Eve smiles, moves a little closer to Chance.
    
    				EVE
    		...You know, Chauncey... I
    		want us to be...
    			(with difficulty)
    		I want us... You and I to
    		become... close... I want us
    		to become very close, you know...?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes, Eve.  I know that.
    
    	Eve suddenly begins to cry, sobbing quietly at first,
    	then losing control, the tears flowing freely.  To
    	comfort her, Chance puts his arm around her shoulder,
    	nearly tipping his breakfast tray.  Eve responds to
    	his touch, draws closer, holds Chance tightly.  Chance
    	does his best to avoid slipping his breakfast, keep an
    	eye on the Tv, and to comfort Eve.  She begins to caress
    	Chance, running her hand over his body.   She kisses him,
    	his eyes, his neck, his lips, his ears.  Chance does not
    	return the lovemaking, and Eve eventually catches hold of
    	herself, stops.  She lies quietly beside Chance for a
    	time, regains her demeanor, then speaks.
    
    				EVE
    		...I'm grateful to you, Chauncey...
    		I would have opened to you with a
    		touch, and you know that...
    			(Chance, confused,
    			turns to her)
    
    				EVE (cont'd)
    		...But you're so strong - I can
    		trust myself with you...
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes, Eve.  I'm very glad that
    		you didn't open.
    
    				EVE
    		I know you are, Chauncey... And
    		I appreciate why you've decided
    		to wait...until...until...
    
    	There is a long moment, then Eve rises, straightens her
    	robe and moves toward the door.
    
    				EVE
    			(stopping by door)
    		...I do love you, Chauncey.
    
    	Eve leaves.  Chance eats his once-warm scrambled eggs and
    	watches "Mr. Roger's Neighborhood" on TV.
    
    101	INT. RAND MANSION - ALLENBY'S ROOM - DAY
    
    	Allenby is at his desk, searching through the Washington,
    	D. C. telphone book.  He finds a number, dials.
    
    				ALLENBY
    			(into phone)
    		Mr. Thomas Franklin, please.
    			(a wait)
    		Is Thomas Franklin in?
    			(a beat)
    		Yes, this is Dr. Robert Allenby,
    		would you please tell Mr. Franklin
    		that I would like to talk to him?
    		It concerns Chauncey Gardiner.
    
    102	INT. RAND'S ROOM - DUSK
    
    	Rand is in bed, very still, deep in thought.  Teresa and
    	Constance work in the background.
    
    103	 EXT. SOPHIE'S - NIGHT
    
    	Chance wears Ben's tuxedo and Eve is done to the teeth
    	as they emerge from the limousine and are met by the
    	press: a couple of reporters, 5 photographers and a
    	mini-cam crew from a local TV station.
    
    				REPORTER #1
    		Mr. Gardiner, what did you
    		think of the Posts' editorial
    		on the President's speech?
    
    				CHANCE
    			(smiling for photogs)
    		I didn't read it.
    
    				REPORTER #2
    		But sir - you must have at least
    		glanced at it.
    
    				CHANCE
    		No.  I did not glance at it.
    
    				REPORTER #3
    		Mr. Gardiner, the New York Times
    		spoke of your 'Peculiar brand of
    		optimism,' what was your reaction
    		to that?
    
    				CHANCE
    			(continues to pose
    			for pictures)
    		I did not read that either.
    
    				REPORTER #3
    		Well, how do you feel about that
    		phrase, 'Peculiar brand of
    		optimism?'
    
    				CHANCE
    		I do not know what it means.
    
    				REPORTER #2
    		Sorry to persist, sir, but it
    		would be of great interest to
    		me to know what newspapers you
    		do read.
    
    				CHANCE
    		I do not read any newspapers.
    		I watch TV.
    
    	There is a moment of silence as the reporters digest this.
    	The TV Reporter smiles, questions Chance.
    
    				TV REPORTER
    		...Do you mean, Mr. Gardiner, that
    		you find television's coverage of the
    		news superior to that of the news-
    		papers?
    
    				CHANCE
    			(flatly)
    		I like to watch TV.
    
    				TV REPORTER
    		Thank you, Mr. Gardiner.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(thinks the interview
    			is over)
    		You're welcome.
    
    	Chance turns and goes toward the house, Eve follows.
    	the TV Reporter turns to the TV camera.
    
    				TV REPORTER
    		Well, that is probably the most
    		honest admission to come from a
    		public figure in years.  Few
    		men in public life have the
    		courage not to read newspapers.
    		None, that this reporter has met,
    		have the guts to admit it.
    
    104	INT. SOPHIE'S - EVENING
    
    	Chance and Eve move through the hallway toward the Living
    	Room.
    
    				EVE
    		I've never seen anyone handle
    		the press the way you do,
    		Chauncey - you're so cool and
    		detatched.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Thank you, Eve.
    
    	They move on to reveal the Black Tie Reception in progress,
    	crowded with Ambassadors and other such dignitaries.
    	SOPHIE ROWLEY, the hostess, comes rushing toward to greet
    	them.
    
    105	INT. WASHINGTON, D.C. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT
    
    	The same lounge as before.  Sidney Courtney sits at the
    	same table as earlier, only this time with the editor
    	of the Washington Post, LYMAN STUART.  Courtney puffs
    	on his pipe as he speaks.
    
    				COURTNEY
    		...It's strictly rumor at this
    		stage, Lyman - just something
    		in the wind...
    
    				STUART
    		Something rather big in the
    		wind, I'd say.  So whose files
    		were destroyed?  The CIA's or
    		the FBI's?
    
    				COURTNEY
    		I don't know.  But we should
    		start nosing around, see if we
    		can talk to some people...
    
    	The CAMERA begins to slowly MOVE AWAY from their table.
    
    				STUART
    		What is it about his past they
    		are trying to cover up?
    			(his volume fades)
    		...A criminal record?  A
    		membership in a subversive
    		organization?  Homosexual,
    		perhaps?
    
    	The SOUND of Stuart's voice dissolves into Thomas
    	Franklin's as the CAMERA SETTLES on Dr. Allenby and
    	Franklin sitting at a table nearby.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		...And he told us that he had been
    		living there since he was a child,
    		working as a gardener.  He showed
    		us a room in the garage, where he
    		said he stayed, and I... Well, I
    		didn't really believe him, of
    		course - but why the act?  He
    		must have been involved on some
    		major financial level with the
    		deceased...
    			(catches himself)
    		Mr. Jennings, but our firm has
    		no record of any such transactions.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		Hmmm.  You say he showed you
    		his garden?
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		Well, he said it was his, he
    		walked us through it.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		I see.
    			(leans close to
    			Franklin)
    		Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and
    		Miss Hayes to keep this incident
    		with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves.
    		There's no telling what he was
    		involved in, and the matter may
    		be extremely confidential.  So
    		please, not a word.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		Of course, Doctor, I understand.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		Fine.  Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
    
    				FRANKLIN
    		Certainly, glad to be of help.
    
    	Allenby rises, leaves the bar.
    
    106	INT. SOPHIE'S - NIGHT
    
    	Sophie pulls Eve and Chance to AMBASSADOR SKRAPINOV and
    	his WIFE.  As they arrive, Eve steps in front of Sophie and
    	makes the introduction.
    
    				EVE
    		Mr. Chauncey Gardiner, let me
    		introduce you to the guest of
    		honor, His Excellency Vladimar
    		Skrapinov, Ambassador of the
    		Soviet Union.
    
    	Chance warmly shakes Skrapinov's hand with both of his own.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(stumbles over name)
    		Hello... His... His...
    
    				SKRAPINOV
    		Delighted, Mr. Gardiner...
    			(a nod to Eve)
    		Mrs. Rand, delighted.
    
    				SOPHIE
    		And this is Mrs. Skrapinov.
    
    	Chance smiles at Mrs. Skrapinov as The Ambassador puts
    	am arm around him.
    
    				SKRAPINOV
    			(to Chance and Eve)
    		You must sit with us, my
    		friends, we have much to
    		discuss.
    
    				CHANCE
    		I agree.
    
    				SOPHIE
    			(tugs at Eve)
    		Come, Eve, let's let the men
    		talk.
    			(to Chance and
    			Skrapinov)
    		Would you two excuse us for
    		a moment?
    
    				SKRAPINOV
    		Regretfully - we shall yield the
    		pleasure of your company to
    		others.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes, Eve.  I shall yield, too.
    
    				EVE
    		Fine.  You two have a nice chat.
    
    	Skrapinov leads his wife and Chance to their table as Eve
    	and Sophie move through the crowd.
    
    				EVE
    			(with self-importance)
    		You see?  Didn't I tell you?
    
    				SOPHIE
    		Oh, I'm so glad you brought him,
    		it makes everything perfect.
    			(looks back at Chance)
    		He's very, very sexy - don't let
    		me alone with him for too long...
    
    	A smiling Senator Jensen comes out of the crowd.
    
    				SENATOR JENSEN
    
    		Mrs. Rand!  How good to see you!
    
    				EVE
    		Well, Senator Jensen.
    
    				SENATOR JENSEN
    		I certainly would like to meet
    		Mr. Gardiner.
    
    				EVE
    		I'm sure you would.
    
    	Eve turns away, Sophie follows.
    
    	As they are met by the Senator, we CUT.
    
    107	INT. SOPHIE'S - NIGHT
    
    	Chance is seated between Ambassador Skrapinov and his
    	wife at their table.
    
    				SKRAPINOV
    			(moves chair close
    			to Chance)
    		Considering the gravity of your
    		economic situation, Mr. Gardiner,
    		shouldn't we, the diplomats, and
    		you, the businessmen - get together
    		more often to exchange our thoughts?
    		What does a Russian know about
    		business?  On the other hand,
    		what does an American know about
    		diplomacy?  So why not a coming
    		together?  An interchange of
    		opinion?  We may find, my friend,
    		that we are not so far from each
    		other, not so far!
    
    				CHANCE
    			(an engaging smile)
    		We are not so far...
    			(motions at nearness
    			of their chairs)
    		...our chairs almost touch.
    
    				SKRAPINOV
    			(laughs)
    		Bravo!  Bravo!  Our chairs are
    		indeed almost touching!  And
    		we want to remain seated on
    		them, correct?  We don't want
    		them snatched from under us,
    		am I right?  Because if one
    		goes, the other goes, and then -
    		boom!  Boom!  And Boom, Boom!
    		And we are both down before our
    		time, you see?  And neither of
    		us wants that, do you agree?
    
    				CHANCE
    		I certainly do.
    
    				SKRAPINOV
    		Yes.  Tell me, Mr. Gardiner -
    		do you by any chance enjoy
    		Krylov's fables?  I ask this
    		because there is something...
    		there is something Krylovian
    		about you.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Do you think so?  Do you
    		think so?
    
    				SKRAPINOV
    		So you know Krylov!
    
    	Skrapinov pauses, then leans close to Chance, speaks
    	softly in Russian.  Chance, having never heard this
    	language, raises his eyebrows and laughs.  Mrs. Skrapinov
    	remains impassive.
    
    				SKRAPINOV
    			(amazed)
    		So you know your Krylov in
    		Russian, do you?  Mr. Gardiner,
    		I must confess I had suspected
    		as much all along.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(beat)
    		Would you tell me your name
    		again, please?
    
    				SKRAPINOV
    			(slaps Chance on
    			the back)
    		Ho!  Ho!  A dash of American
    		humor!  Vladimar Skrapinov!
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  I like that name very
    		much.
    
    				SKRAPINOV
    		And yours, sir - Chauncey
    		Gardiner!
    			(in Russian)
    		How poetic!  Chauncey, a name
    		of uncertain meaning!  And
    		Gardiner, a bit of French,
    		a suggestion of a stroll through
    		the flowers!  A beautiful name,
    		my friend!
    
    108	INT. WHITE HOUSE - PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
    
    	A light from the adjoining bathroom filters into the
    	darkened bedroom.  The President and the First Lady
    	are in bed.  They each lie on their backs, a distance
    	apart and are silent.
    
    				FIRST LADY
    			(after some time)
    		...Maybe you should talk to
    		somebody, darling.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		No, that won't do any good.
    
    				FIRST LADY
    			(another pause)
    		...Is it me?  Is there something
    		I've done?
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not
    		you...
    
    				FIRST LADY
    			(another pause)
    		It's your damn job.  It never
    		happened when you were a
    		senator...
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		It's not that, I just...
    
    	The inter-White House phone buzzes, the President reaches
    	for it.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    			(into phone)
    		Yeah, Kaufman - what is it?
    
    				KAUFMAN'S VOICE
    			(over phone)
    		Chief, we have a break in the
    		case.  Our man at the Washington
    		Post says they are working on a
    		story that either the CIA or the
    		FBI destroyed Gardiner's files
    		before anyone could get to them.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		What?  Why?
    
    				KAUFMAN'S VOICE
    			(over phone)
    		I can't say at this time -
    		neither agency will admit to a
    		thing.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    			(getting out of bed)
    		Okay, get Honeycutt and Baldwin
    		over here, I'll be right down.
    
    	The President hangs up the phone as the First Lady stares
    	at the ceiling.
    
    109	INT. SOPHIE'S - NIGHT
    
    	Eve and Chance are talking.  AMBASSADOR GAUFRIDI of France
    	edges toward them.
    
    				EVE
    		Chauncey, you had Ambassador
    		Skrapinov eating out of your
    		hand, and you never told me
    		you spoke Russian.  That's
    		incredible!
    
    	Gaufridi joins in.
    
    				GAUFRIDI
    		It's extremely useful to speak
    		Russian these days.  Are you
    		proficient in other languages,
    		Mr. Gardiner?
    
    				EVE
    		Mr. Gardiner is a modest man,
    		Ambassador Gaufridi.  He
    		doesn't advertise his acoomplish-
    		ments, his knowledge is for
    		himself.
    
    	Chance smiles, then turns away to select an hors d'oeuvre,
    	where he is approached by RONALD STIEGLER, a publisher.
    
    				STIEGLER
    		Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler,
    		of Harvard Books.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(a two-handed
    			handshake)
    		Hello, Ronald.
    
    				STIEGLER
    		Mr. Gardiner, my editors and
    		I have been wondering if you'd
    		consider writing a book for us?
    		Something on your political
    		philosophy.  What do you say?
    
    				CHANCE
    		I can't write.
    
    				STIEGLER
    			(smiles)
    		Of course, who can nowadays?  I
    		have trouble writing a post card
    		to my children!  Look, we could
    		give you a six figure advance,
    		provide you with the very best
    		ghostwriters, research assistants,
    		proof readers...
    
    				CHANCE
    		I can't read.
    
    				STIEGLER
    		Of course not!  No one has the
    		time to read!  One glances at
    		things, watches television...
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  I like to watch.
    
    				STIEGLER
    		Sure you do!  No one reads!
    		...Listen, book publishing isn't
    		exactly a bed of roses these days...
    
    				CHANCE
    			(mild interest)
    		What sort of bed is it?
    
    110	INT. SOPHIE'S - NIGHT
    
    	KARPATOV, an aide, sits next to Skrapinov and his wife.
    
    				SKRAPINOV
    
    		I want to know everything about
    		his relationship with Rand.  And
    		found out the real reason the
    		President has singled him out.
    			(Karpatov takes
    			notes)
    		And I want this quote included in
    		the TASS coverage...
    		"Chauncy Gardiner, in an intimate
    		discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov,
    		noted that 'unless the leaders
    		of the opposing political systems
    		move the chairs on which they sit
    		closer to each other, all of their
    		seats will be pulled from under
    		them by rapid social and political
    		changes.'"
    
    	Karpatov writes out the quote.
    
    111	INT. SOPHIE'S - NIGHT
    
    	Eve is with SENATOR SLIPSHOD, MRS. SLIPSHOD, and DENNIS
    	WATSON of the State Department.
    
    				SENATOR
    		I heard that he speaks eight
    		languages, and on top of every-
    		thing else, holds a degree in
    		medicine as well as law.  Isn't
    		that true, Eve?
    
    				EVE
    		Well, I really don't know,
    		Senator, but it wouldn't
    		surprise me.
    
    				MRS. SLIPSHOD
    		He's very attractive.
    
    				EVE
    		Isn't he?
    
    				DENNIS
    		Yes... Very.
    
    112	INT. RAND'S ROOM - NIGHT
    
    	Allenby enters the room quietly and stands in the shadows
    	watching Rand sitting up in bed with a large loose-leaf
    	type book on his lap.  He has a dictaphone mike in one hand,
    	with the other, he moves his finger down a page and stops.
    
    				RAND
    			(into mike)
    		Sell all 750,000 shares of C.C.T.

    		...Let's see - just sell a

    			(takes a beat)
    		Oh, and Mrs. Aubrey, have
    		30,000 shares of Standard
    		transferred into your name.
    		That's for you.

    		Robert... I was just cleaning
    		up some loose ends - getting
    		rid of some of the dead wood
    		so Eve won't have to put up
    		with it...
    
    				ALLENBY
    			(a beat)
    		...Ben, I want to talk to you
    		about Chauncey.
    
    				RAND
    			(smiles)
    		Oh, yes - Chauncey - you know,
    		Robert - there's something about
    		him that I trust - he makes me
    		feel good.  Since he's been
    		around, the thought of dying
    		has been much easier for me.
    
    	Allenby is silent and thoughtful.
    
    113	INT. SOPHIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    
    	Dennis Watson is a homosexual and is coming on strong
    	to Chance.
    
    				DENNIS
    		...You're fascinating, Mr. Gardiner -
    		I've never met anyone like you in
    		Washington before.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes, I've been here all my life.
    
    				DENNIS
    		Really?  Well, where have you
    		been all my life?
    			(Chance smiles)
    		Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, have you
    		ever had sex with a man?
    
    				CHANCE
    			(a beat)
    		No.  I don't think so.
    
    				DENNIS
    		We could go upstairs right now.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Do they have a TV upstairs?
    
    				DENNIS
    		A TV?  I'm sure they do.
    
    				CHANCE
    		I like to watch.
    
    				DENNIS
    		You like to waaaaaatch?  Well -
    		you wait right here, I'll go get
    		Warren.
    
    	Dennis hurries off.  Eve appears, moves to Chance.
    
    				EVE
    		Let's get out of here, Chauncey -
    		Let's go home...
    
    	Eve takes Chance by the arm and they move off.
    
    114	INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
    
    	The President sits behind his desk in a bathrobe, his
    	hair mussed.  Standing before him are GROVER HONEYCUTT,
    	the Director of the FBI, and CLIFFORD BALDWIN, CIA Chief.
    	Kaufman stands to one side.  All are red-eyed, tired,
    	and frustrated.
    
    				HONEYCUTT
    		I never gave such a directive,
    		Mr. President.
    
    				BALDWIN
    		Nor I, sir - it would be out
    		of the question.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		Gentlemen, I didn't call you
    		here at such an hour to make
    		accusations, I just want to
    		explore the possibilities.
    		Now, I have three questions:
    		Is the man a foreign agent?
    		Or, have we suddenly found
    		that our methods of gathering
    		data are grossly inefficient?
    		Or, thirdly, have the man's
    		files been destroyed?  Now,
    		I'd like some answers.
    
    				BALDWIN
    		Gardiner is not a forign agent,
    		there are now sixteen countries
    		investigating the man.  We can
    		rule that out.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		Very well...  Can we rule out
    		inefficiency?
    
    	There is silence in the room.  A couple of looks, but
    	silence.
    
    				PRESIDNENT
    		I see.  What about question
    		three?  Is it possible to
    		erase all traces of a man?
    
    				HONEYCUTT
    		Highly unlikely, sir... In
    		fact, the boys around the Bureau
    		feel that the only person capable
    		of pulling it off would be an ex-
    		F.B.I. man.
    
    				BALDWIN
    			(a look to Honeycutt)
    		I don't think that's entirely
    		true, Grover.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    			(to Baldwin)
    		And what do the boys around
    		Intelligence think?
    
    				BALDWIN
    		Well, Mr. President...  They
    		don't know quite what to think.
    
    	More silence, more looks.
    
    115	INT. RAND LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
    
    	Chance watches TV.  Eve sits beside him, her hand on his
    	thigh.
    
    				EVE
    		I feel so close to you, so
    		safe with you, Chauncey...
    		and Benjamin understands that,
    		dearest... He understands and
    		accepts my feelings for you...
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  Ben is very wise.
    
    	Eve moves her hand up higher on Chance's thigh, there is
    	no reaction.
    
    116	INT. RAND MANSION - 3rd FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
    
    	Eve and Chance stand close together in the hallway.
    
    				EVE
    		...It's difficult to say good
    		night to you, Chauncey - it's
    		very hard for me to leave you.
    
    				CHANCE
    		It's very hard for me, too, Eve.
    
    				EVE
    		...Oh.
    
    	Flustered at the thought, Eve turns and leaves.  Chance watches
    	her go, then moves off to his room.
    
    117	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - NIGHT
    
    	Chance is propped up in bed, watches an old movie on tele-
    	vision.  The hero gives his lady a passionate kiss and embrace.
    	The scene seems to 'sink into' Chance's mind.  Suddenly, Eve,
    	robe over her nightgown, comes into the room.
    
    				EVE
    		Oh, Chauncey - I just couldn't stand
    		it any longer.
    
    	She goes to the bed, takes Chance in her arms, starts to kiss
    	him, when he abruptly takes Eve into his arms and kisses her
    	full on the mouth.  Once done, Chance's attention returns to
    	the television while Eve is in a frenzy of passion.  She
    	holds him, kisses him, runs her hands over his body.
    	Chance neither resists nor responds, he just watches
    	television.  Suddenly Eve stops, lets her head fall on
    	Chance's chest.
    
    				EVE
    		...You don't want me, Chauncey...
    		You don't feel anything for me...
    		Nothing at all...
    
    	Chance, feeling her sadness, gently strokes her hair as he
    	looks at TV.
    
    				EVE
    		...I just don't excite you...
    		I don't know what you want.. I
    		don't know what you like...
    
    				CHANCE
    		I like to watch.
    
    				EVE
    			(not understanding)
    		To watch...?  To watch me...?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  I like to watch.
    
    				EVE
    			(uncertain)
    		...Is that all you want...?
    			(a hesitation)
    		...To watch me...?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  It's very good, Eve.
    
    				EVE
    		...But I've never done...
    			(another hesitation)
    		...You mean...?  When... When...
    		When I do it?...  When I touch
    		myself...?
    
    	Eve slowly gets up from the bed, nervously paces the bed-
    	room as Chance watches TV.  She makes a decision, moves
    	to Chance, kisses him.
    
    				EVE
    			(getting aroused)
    		Oh, Chauncey... I do love you so
    		much.
    
    	She steps back, slips off her robe.  She does not undress
    	any further, instead, leans close to Chance.
    
    				EVE
    		One of those little things you
    		don't know about me yet, darling -
    		I'm a little shy.
    
    	She smiles, drops to the floor.  Chance divides his attention
    	between Eve and the TV, watching both with an equal detach-
    	ment.  Eve becomes more and more involved with herself,
    	finding immense pleasure with her own body.  Chance changes
    	the channel with the remote control.  Eve reaches orgasm, her
    	body shaking violently, then a delicate tremor.  Then she is
    	still.  Chance turns off the TV with the remote, turns over
    	in bed.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Good night, Eve.
    
    	A low purr is heard from Eve.
    
    118	INT. RAND'S ROOM - MORNING
    
    	There is a feeling of urgency as Allenby and the nurses
    	attend to Rand.
    
    				ALLENBY
    			(to nurses)
    		Get set up for a transfusion
    		right away.
    
    				RAND
    			(very weakly)
    		...No more, Robert - no more
    		needles...
    
    				ALLENBY
    		It's not good, Ben - I'm
    		sure you can feel it.
    
    				RAND
    		I know, Robert... I know...
    
    119	INT. RAND MANSION - PATIO - MORNING
    
    	A light snow is falling.  Eve is in a fur coat, holds a
    	steaming cup of coffee.  Chance stands near her next to
    	the railing.  He reaches out, catches snowflakes as they
    	fall.
    
    				EVE
    		...And I feel so free now,
    		Chauncey.  I never felt so
    		acknowledged by a man...
    		Until I met you, I always
    		had the feeling that I was
    		just a vessel for a man,
    		something that he could take
    		hold of, pierce, and pollute.
    		I was merely an aspect of
    		somebody's lovemaking.  Do
    		you know what I mean?
    
    	Chance turns to her, says nothing, presses the cold snow-
    	flakes to his face.
    
    				EVE
    		You uncoil my wants; desire
    		flows within me, and when you
    		watch me my passion dissolves
    		it.  You set me free. I
    		reveal myself to myself and I
    		am drenched and purged.
    
    	Teresa appears in the doorway.
    
    				TERESA
    		Mr. Gardiner.  Mr. Rand would
    		like to see you.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  I would like to see Ben.
    
    	Chance gives Eve a warm smile, then follows Teresa into
    	the house.
    
    120	INT. RAND'S ROOM - MORNING
    
    	Allenby, with nothing more he can do to prolong Rand's
    	life, stands close to him, grips his hand tightly.  Teresa
    	shows Chance into the room and Allenby motions to the nurses
    	to leave.  Chance, with a smile, goes to Rand's bedside.
    
    				RAND
    			(slowly)
    		...Chauncey... Chauncey...
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
    
    	Allenby winces.
    
    				RAND
    			(a weak smile)
    		...I'm about to surrender the
    		Horn of Plenty for the Horn
    		of Gabriel, my boy...
    
    				CHANCE
    		I see.
    
    				RAND
    			(reaches out to him)
    		Let me feel the strength in
    		your hand, Chauncey... Let me
    		feel your strength...
    			(holds Chance's hand)
    		Yes, that's good... I hope,
    		Chauncey - I hope that you'll
    		stay with Eve... Take care of
    		her, watch over her, she's a
    		delicate flower, Chauncey...
    
    				CHANCE
    			(smiling)
    		A flower...
    
    				RAND
    		She cares for you and she needs
    		your help, Chauncey... there's
    		much to be looked after...
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  I would like to do that.
    
    				RAND
    		...My associates, Chauncey - I've
    		talked with them about you...
    		They're eager to meet with you...
    		very eager...
    			(trails off)
    		...Tell Eve..
    
    	Rand slumps down, dead.  Allenby checks his pulse, turns
    	to Chance.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		...He's gone, Chauncey.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes, Robert.  I have seen it
    		before.  It happens to old
    		people.
    
    				ALLENBY
    			(covers Rand's face)
    		Yes, I suppose that's true.
    
    	Chance reaches out, uncovers Rand's face, gently touches
    	the man's forehead, feels the coldness.  Allenby eyes him
    	as Chance stays with Rand for a moment, then replaces the
    	sheet.
    
    				CHANCE
    			(turns to Allenby)
    		Will you be leaving now, Robert?
    
    				ALLENBY
    		In a day or two, yes.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Eve is going to stay.  The house
    		will not be closed.
    
    				ALLENBY
    			(a moment, a look)
    		...You've become quite a close
    		friend of Eve's - haven't you...
    			(a beat)
    		...Chance...?
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  I love Eve very much.
    
    				ALLENBY
    		I see...
    			(another beat)
    		...And you really are a gardener,
    		aren't you?
    
    				CHANCE
    			(brightens)
    		Yes, Robert - I am.
    			(a smile at Allenby)
    		I'll got tell Eve about Ben now,
    		Robert.
    
    	Chance leaves the bedroom.  Allenby watches him go, then
    	sits back in a chair, his head spinning.
    
    121	EXT. RAND ESTATE - DAY
    
    	Rand's funeral services are being held on a hill overlooking
    	the mansion.  Six distinguished-looking men stand near Rand's
    	casket, which is placed on a concrete block.  They are the
    	PALLBEARERS.  The Rand mausoleum is fifty yards further up
    	the hill, while the MOURNERS, all close friends and associates
    	of Rand's, stand fifty yards down the hill from the pallbearers.
    	Chance stands with Eve and Allenby.  The President of the
    	United States is before the microphone, which feeds loudspeakers
    	for the Rand servants lined up in front of the mansion.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    		...I know that Ben said keep it
    		small and quiet... No eulogies,
    		no fanfares... And I don't want
    		to go against Ben's wishes.  But
    		I thought it would be good, while
    		our close friends carry Ben to
    		his last resting place, to read
    		from his quotes, which I'm sure
    		will have special meaning to all
    		of us who are gathered here today.
    
    	With this, the Pallbearers pick up the casket and begin
    	the chore of taking it to the mausoleum.  It is hard
    	work.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    			(reading quotes)
    		... 'I have no use for those on
    		welfare, no patience whatsoever...
    		But if I am to be honest with
    		myself, I must admit that they
    		have no use for me, either.'
    
    		... 'I do not regret having
    		political differences with men
    		that I respect; I do regret,
    		however, that our philosophies
    		kept us apart.'
    
    		... 'I was born into a position
    		of extreme wealth, but I have
    		spent many sleeples nights
    		thinking about extreme poverty.'
    
    	As the President speaks, Chance turns and walks away.  Eve
    	and Allenby watch as he goes toward the trees surrounding
    	the area.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    			(continues reading)
    		... 'When I was a boy, I was told
    		that the Lord fashioned us from
    		his own image.  That's when I
    		decided to manufacture mirrors.'
    
    		... 'Life is a state of mind.'
    
    	The Pallbearers are enroute, they are all breathing
    	heavily.  JAMES DUDLEY, a powerful industrialist, speaks.
    
    				DUDLEY
    		Yes, I agree, Maxwell would be an
    		excellent man for the job - but
    		he's boring, he would never take
    		an election.
    
    	SEWELL NELSON, a corporation Chairman, speaks.
    
    				NELSON
    		Correct, the people of this
    		country need to be awakened.
    
    	PETER CALDWELL, another executive:
    
    				CALDWELL
    		What about Lawson?  He's
    		charismatic, exciting...
    
    				DUDLEY
    		A bit too exciting, I'm afriad...
    		Once they start bringing things
    		up about his background.
    
    	WEBB, Railroad money:
    
    				WEBB
    		Well, gentlemen.  Time is running
    		out, we must come to a decision.
    
    122	EXT. WOODS - DAY
    
    	Chance, his umbrella under his arm, walks through the woods.
    	He stops by a tree, brushes some snow from a branch, moves on.
    
    123	EXT. RAND ESTATE - DAY
    
    	The President is still reading Rand's quotes.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    			(reading)
    		'The world parts with Rand, and
    		Rand parts with the world:  A
    		fair trade, don't you agree?
    		Security, tranquility, a well-
    		deserved rest:  All the aims I
    		have pursued will soon be
    		realized.'
    
    	Eve is concerned about Chance, she turns to Allenby.
    
    				EVE
    			(quietly)
    		I've got to find Chauncey.
    
    	She leaves the funeral, heads toward the trees.
    
    				PRESIDENT
    			(reading)
    		...'I do not know the feelings
    		of being poor, and that is not
    		to know the feelings of the
    		majority of people in this
    		world.  For a man in my position,
    		that is inexcusable.
    
    	The Pallbearers near the mausoleum, they are struggling.
    
    				DUDLEY
    		But what do we know of the man?
    		Nothing!  We have no inkling of
    		his past!
    
    				NELSON
    		Correct, and that is an asset.
    		A man's past can cripple him,
    		his background turns into a
    		swamp and invites scrutiny.
    
    				CALDWELL
    		...Up to this time, he hasn't
    		said anything that could be used
    		against him.
    
    				NELSON
    		The response from his appearance
    		on the 'Burns Show' was over-
    		whelming; mail and telephone
    		response was the highest they
    		ever had, and it was ninety-five
    		percent pro!
    
    	CHARLIE BOB BENNET, a Texas oil millionaire;
    
    				BENNET
    		Well, I'm certainly open to the
    		thought - it would be sheer
    		lunacy to support the President
    		for another term.
    
    	LYMAN MURRAY, a banker;
    
    				MURRAY
    		Exactly.  That is why I agree
    		with Ben's final wishes, and
    		I firmly believe, gentlemen,
    		if we want to retain the
    		Presidency, that our one and
    		onlt chance is Chauncey Gardiner!
    
    124	EXT. WOODS - DAY
    
    	Chance happens on a tree with a cracked limb, hanging to
    	the ground.  He stops, inspects the break, runs his fingers
    	along the split of the bark.  He looks to the ground, notices
    	that an end of the limb has fallen on a seedling, bending it
    	double.  Chance pulls the limb away, then kneels beside the
    	seedling.  He removes an expensive pair of suede gloves, and,
    	with gentle fingers, brushes the dirt and snow away from the
    	seedling.  Chance glances up to the remaining limbs of the
    	larger tree which could fall and threaten the emerging tree.
    	He unflods his umbrella, places it over the seedling in a way
    	to give it protection, yet still allow it to receive light
    	from the winter sun.  Chance stands, and is putting his gloves
    	on when Eve appears, running towards him.
    
    				EVE
    			(breathless)
    		Chauncey!  Chauncey!
    
    				CHANCE
    			(looks)
    		Hello, Eve.
    
    				EVE
    			(holds him)
    		Oh, Chauncey, darling.  Where were
    		you?  I've been looking for you.
    		I was scared.
    
    				CHANCE
    		Yes.  I've been looking for you
    		too, Eve.
    
    	She hugs him one more time, then leads him back from whence she
    	came.  The President can still be heard reading quotes.
    
    				PRESIDENT'S VOICE
    			(in the distance)
    		I've lived a lot, trembled a lot,
    		was surrounded by little men who
    		forgot that we enter naked and
    		exit naked and that no accountant
    		can audit life in our favor.
    
    
    
    				THE END
