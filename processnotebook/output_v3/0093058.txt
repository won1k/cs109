>>>          "I can't hear you!  Sound off like you got a

>>>          _"YES, SIR!"_

>>>     I'm going to hate this movie."

>>>          Cowboy laughs.

>>>          Gunnery Sergeant Gerheim laughs, too.  The

>>>     senior drill instructor is an obscene little ogre

>>>     in immaculate khaki.

>>>          Sergeant Gerheim walks slowly back along the

>>>     line of recruits.  "Who said that?"

>>>          Silence.

>>>          Sergeant Gerheim peers into each face.  "Who

>>>     said that?"

>>>          "I did, sir," Joker says.

>>>     Sergeant Gerheim aims his index finger

>>>     between Joker's eyes and says, "Private Joker... I

>>>     like honesty.  I like you.  You can come over to

>>>     my house and fuck my sister."

>>>          He grins.  He punches Joker in the stomach.

>>>     _"If_ you ladies leave my island, _if_ you survive

>>>     be a minister of death, praying for war. And

>>>              Leonard Grins.

>>>          "Private Pyle thinks I am a real funny guy.

>>>     He thinks that Parris Island is more fun then a

>>>     sucking chest wound."

>>>          The hillbilly's fact is frozen into a

>>>     permanent expression of oat-fed innocence.

>>>          He punches Leonard in the chest.

>>>          "You maggots are not going to have any fun

>>>     here.  You are not going to enjoy standing in

>>>     straight lines and you are not going to enjoy

>>>     massaging your own wand. My orders are to weed

>>>     out all nonhackers who do not pack the gear to

>>>     serve in my beloved Corps.  Because I am hard, you

>>>     will not like me.  But the more you hate me, the

>>>     more you will learn.  I am hard but I am fair.

>>>     There is no racial bigotry here.  We do not look

>>>     down on niggers, kikes, wop or greasers, because

>>>     here you are all equally worthless.  Do you

>>>     understand?"

>>>          Some of them mumble, "Yes.  Yeah.  Yes,sir."

>>>          "I can't _hear_ you, ladies!"

>>>          "Yes, sir!"

>>>          "I _still_ can't hear you, ladies!"

>>>              "YES, SIR!"

>>>          "You piss me off. Hit the deck."

>>>          They crumple down onto the parade deck.

>>>          "You got no motivation.  Do you hear me,

>>>          Sergeant Gerheim struts, ramrod straight,

>>>     hands on hips.  "GET UP! GET UP!"

>>>          They get up, knees Sore, hands gritty.

>>>          Sergeant Gerheim says to his two junior drill

>>>     instructors: "What a humble herd."  Then to the

>>>     recruits: "You silly scumbags are too slow.  Hit

>>>          _Down.

>>>          Up.

>>>          Down.

>>>          Up._

>>>          "HIT IT!"

>>>          Down.

>>>          Sergeant Gerheim steps over their struggling

>>>     bodies, stomps fingers, kicks ribs with the toe of

>>>     his boot.  "Jesus H. Christ.  You maggots are

>>>     huffing and puffing the way your momma did the

>>>     first time your old man put the meat to her."

>>>          _Pain._

>>>          "GET UP! GET UP!"

>>>          _Up._  Muscles aching.

>>>          Leonard Pratt is slow getting up.

>>>          Sergeant Gerheim stands over him.  "Okay,

>>>     scumbag, on your feet."

>>>          Leonard gets up on one knee, hesitates, then

>>>     stands up, inhaling and exhaling.  He grins.

>>>          "Why are you grinning at me, Private Pyle?"

>>>          "I don't know, sir."

>>>          "You are grinning at me, you ugly ape!"

>>>          "I can't help it, sir!"

>>>          "You got a crush on me?"

>>>          "No, sir!"

>>>          "Don't lie to me."

>>>          "Sir, I'm not...lying to you."

>>>          _"YOU? YOU?_  Did you say _YOU?_  Do you know

>>>     what a ewe is?  A ewe is a female sheep.  A female

>>>     sheep is for fucking!"

>>>          "Sir..."

>>>          "Why do you want to fuck your drill

>>>     instructor???"

>>>          Sergeant Gerheim punches Leonard in the chest

>>>     hard.  Leonard doubles over with pain. "LOCK THEM

>>>     HEELS!  YOU'RE AT ATTENTION!"

>>>          Leonard comes to attention.  Eyes front.  But

>>>     the trace of a grin remains.

>>>          "Wipe that grin off your face."

>>>          The grin is involuntary and Leonard cannot

>>>     always control it.

>>>          Sergeant Gerheim backhands Leonard across the

>>>     face.

>>>          Blood.

>>>          Leonard locks his heels.  Leonard's lips are

>>>     busted, pink and purple, and his mouth is bloody,

>>>     but Leonard only shrugs and grins as though

>>>     Gunnery Sergeant Gerheim had just given him a

>>>     birthday present.

>>>          "Why did you join the Marines Cops?"

>>>          "To become a man, Sir!"

>>>          "Private Pyle, you may just be the dumbest

>>>     United States Marine recruit in Marine Corps

>>>     history."

>>>

>>>          Close order drill, Leonard makes a mistake.

>>>          "Private Pyle, what are you trying to do to

>>>     my beloved Corps?"

>>>          "I'm sorry, sir," Leonard says.

>>>          "You are dumb Private Pile but do you expect

>>>     me to believe you don't know right from left?"

>>>          "No, sir."

>>>          "Then you did it on purpose.  You want to be

>>>     different."

>>>          "No, sir."  The trace of a grin appears at

>>>     the corners of his mouth.

>>>          "You think I'm stupid."

>>>              "No, sir."

>>>          "Then why are you grinning at me?"

>>>          "I'm not grinning, sir!"

>>>          Gerheim hits Leonard on the right side of his

>>>     face, a hard stunning clap.  Pain takes the grin

>>>     away.

>>>          "What side was that?"

>>>          "Right ride, sir!"

>>>          "Are you sure?"

>>>              "Yes, sir!"

>>>          He slaps him just as hard on the left side.

>>>     "And what side was that?"

>>>          "Left, sir," Leonard says blinking with

>>>     pain.

>>>          "Don't fuck with me again, scumbag."

>>>          "Yes, sir!"

>>>          The close order drill continues.

>>>          Rafter Man nods, eagerly.  Joker looks at the

>>>          The radio operator gives Sergeant Murphy the
