                                                             First Draft
                                                           August 5, 1991
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
         FADE IN:
    
    
    
         PROLOGUE
    
         CLOSE ON:
    
         AN OLD-FASHIONED CALENDAR,
    
         the kind that used to hang in offices in the forties.  Each day
         is a tear-off page.  The dates are printed in bold black
         lettering.
    
         The pages of days of the year zip off -- at a rate faster than
         the eye can really register.  The impression should be of time
         whizzing by...
    
         Over this, SANTA CLAUS narrates....
    
                                     SANTA (V.O.)
                   'Twas a long time ago, quite a bit to be fair
                     In a place that I'm sure you are quite unaware.
    
                   For our story that you are about to be told
                     Began in the holiday worlds of old.
    
                   Without holidays, goodness, how dull life would be
                     Without their distraction and pleasure and glee.
    
         The calendar makes a SUDDEN STOP AT
    
         CHRISTMAS.
    
         The calendar page peels back to reveal the first hint of color in
         the black and white of the year.  Smoke curls up from the chimney
         of a snow-covered cottage in a clearing of a snow-covered pine
         forest.  THE STOP IS ONLY FOR A BEAT.
    
         Then the calendar speeds on.
    
                                     SANTA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   But our holidays are the result of much fuss
                   And hard work for the worlds that must make them for us
    
         The calendar STOPS again.  This time at
    
         VALENTINE'S DAY.
    
         This stop is short, but longer than the last -- as each
         subsequent stop will be.
    
         In Valentine-ville, FAT CUPIDS shoot arrows at distant chocolate-
         dripping hearts: target practice.
    
                                     SANTA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   See, each holiday town works all year to create
                     Twenty-four special hours, fantastically great.
    
         Soon the calendar whirls on.  Next STOP is
    
         EASTER
    
         where it is spring.  CACKLING HENS sit side-by-side on their long
         row of nests.  In unison, choreographed like some ballet, they
         lay their pre-decorated eggs.
    
         The eggs then drop down a chute and land on a conveyor belt which
         carries them out ot the henhouse and into waiting Easter baskets.
    
                                     SANTA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   Fleeting twenty-four hours take long to prepare,
                     A full year of planning and plenty of care.
    
                   But now getting back to the story at hand
                     I should mention THIS POINT about holiday lands --
    
         The calendar flips to the
    
         FOURTH OF JULY.
    
         FIREWORKS.
    
         -- ABE LINCOLN fires a cannon.  The cannonball explodes mid-air,
         showering down the word, "HAPPY."
    
         -- BETSY ROSS uses a SPARKLER to write the word, "FOURTH."
    
         -- PAUL REVERE sets off the first of six rockets.  Rocket #1
         erupts into an "O."  #2 traces an "F" -- together they read "OF."
         Rocket #3 won't light.  Neither will #4, #5, or #6.  Paul Revere
         panicks.
    
         But PAUL REVERE'S HORSE saves the day.  He kicks off his
         horseshoes -- shooting them at the side of a wooden fence.  As
         they hit the boards each becomes a letter: "J," "U," "L," "Y."
    
                                     SANTA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   For each one, way back when, was alas unaware
                   Of the others' existence, now I've said it -- so there!
    
         The calendar pages tear on, slowing at October 29, slowing more
         at, and stopping at the 31st.
    
                                     SANTA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   But once there occurred a calamity SO GREAT!
                     When two of the worlds did collide by mistake...
    
         The october 31st page peels back to... nothing.  To BLACK.  We
         fall in, or perhaps it should feel more like we're swallowed up.
    
         TITLE SEQUENCE.
    
         Carved JACK O'LANTERNS come at us in the long tunnel of darkness.
         Collision seems inevitable, but in the instant before we would
         slam into them, the jack o'lanterns veer off, turning to display
         the various credits on their uncarved backsides.
    
         When the last jack o'lantern zooms toward us, it doesn't veer
         off.  It keeps coming and fast.  Rather than collide with it
         though -- we fall straight into one of the PUMPKINHEAD'S CARVED-
         OUT, TRIANGULAR EYES into the further black there and out...
    
         A CRYPT DOOR
    
         which opens onto the
    
         EXT. HALLOWEENLAND CEMETERY. NIGHT.
    
         The bloated orange disk of the MOON illuminates Halloweenland's
         delicately decrepit graveyard.
    
         REVERSE ON PUMPKINHEAD,
    
         giant jack o'lantern head now set on the squat vines of his many
         leafy legs.  He looks more like a spider than like anything else
         as he scuttles across the cemetery toward the big pumpkin patch.
    
         >>>>> _THIS IS HALLOWEEN_
    
                                     PUMPKINHEAD
    _                      Boys and Girls of every age
                          Wouldn't you like to see something strange?
                          Come with us and you will see...
                          This our town of Halloween!_
    
         Pumpkinhead has reached the
    
         PUMPKIN PATCH
    
         where he drops down among his fellow pumpkins -- who all wake up
         at once -- sudden jack o'lantern mouths and eyes glowing wide for
         the chorus...
    
                                     PUMPKIN PATCH CHORUS
    _                      This is Halloween, this is Halloween!
                            Pumpkins scream in the dead of night --
                          This is Halloween, everybody make a scene
                            Trick or treat 'til the neighbors gonna die of fright!_
    
         EXT. HALLOWEEN TOWN. NIGHT/CONTINUOUS TIME.
    
         Beyond the graveyard lies the little city of odd expressionist
         angles and the morbid extravaganza of Gothic manses.
    
                                     PUMPKIN PATCH CHORUS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
    _                      It's our town.  Everybody scream.
                            In this town of Halloween..._
    
         We swoop down the street, through the creaky iron gate of a...
    
         EXT. DESERTED GOTHIC MANSE. NIGHT/CONTINUOUS TIME.
    
         We enter THROUGH A BROKEN, COBWEB-CLOGGED WINDOW into...
    
         INT. DESERTED GOTHIC MANSE. NIGHT/CONTINUOUS TIME.
    
         Many CREATURES hide in the shadows of this creepy house.  The
         camera finds them...
    
                                     CREATURE #1
    _                      I am the one hiding under your bed,
                            Teeth ground sharp and eyes glowing red._
    
                                     CREATURE #2
    _                      I am the one hiding under your stairs
                            Fingers like snakes and spiders in my hair._
    
         IN THE MANSE'S DECAYED PARLOR,
    
         every item of furniture that could conceivably serve as a coffin
         springs open -- the grandfather clock, the window seat, the sofa,
         the chaise longe, the hearth rug (covering a trap door), the
         drawers of a sideboard and out pop
    
         CORPSES.
    
         The Corpses sit bolt upright and heartily sing:
    
                                     CHORUS OF CORPSES
    _                      This is Halloween, this is Halloween,
                            Halloween...(etc)_
    
         THE MANSE'S FALLING DOWN FRONT HALL
    
         is tenuously illuminated by a tarantula chandelier which clings
         to the ceiling overhead and lowers and rises according to the
         whims of its web.
    
         FOUR BIG VAMPIRES
    
         lumber in from the dark, slanty hallways that fan off the
         entrance hall.  They march in and, in formation, march OUT THE
         FRONT DOOR onto the ruins of--
    
         EXT. WORM-ROTTED FRONT PORCH. NIGHT/CONTINUOUS TIME
    
         The Vampires' bodies are huge, but their heads are small like
         insect heads and the voices that come out of heads are little,
         squeaky and high.
    
                                     VAMPIRES
    _                      In this town, we call home,
                            Everyone hail to the pumpkin song!_
    
         As they sing they march down the rickety steps.  Out on the--
    
         EXT. STREET. NIGHT/CONTINUOUS TIME.
    
         A HEARSE passes the Manse.  Riding on top is the corpulent MAYOR
         of Halloweenland.  Not surprisingly, he's a TWO-FACED SORT OF
         GUY, revealed as each of his faces sings a line:
    
                                     MAYOR
    _                      In this town, don't we love it now
                            Everybody's waiting for the next surprise._
    
         While the hearse turns a
    
         CORNER
    
         and glides past an ALLEY we hear a GRAVELLY VOICE:
    
                                     GRAVELLY VOICE
    _                      'Round that corner, man,
                            Hiding in a trashcan
                          Something's waiting now to pounce and how you'll--_
    
         The lid flies off of a trashcan and out pops the GRAVELLY-VOICED
         TRASHCAN-DWELLING MONSTER.  He's fat and slimy and grotesque.
    
                                     GRAVELLY-VOICED
                                     TRASHCAN-DWELLING MONSTER
    _                      -- Scream!  This is Halloween,
                             Red 'n black, slimy green...
                          Aren't you scared?  Well, that's just fine!_
    
         WITCHES speed toward us on their brooms -- zipping out of the alley.
    
                                     WITCHES
    _                      Say it once, say it twice,
                            Take the chance and roll the dice
                          Ride with the moon in the dead of night (oh)_
    
         At the street, the witches fan out and swoop past the
    
         HANGING TREE,
    
         a gigantic oak with SEVERAL HANGED MEN dangling from its broad,
         outspread branches.
    
         The hanging tree itself sings:
    
                                     HANGING TREE
    _                      Everybody scream, everybody scream
                            In our town of Halloween._
    
         The hanged men suddenly revive:
    
                                     HANGED MEN
    _                      This is Halloween, This is Halloween..._
    
         EXT. ANOTHER STREET. NIGHT.
    
         A LUMPEN-LOOKING LONG-HAIRED WOMAN IN HEELS hurries away down a
         tortuously windy street.  This is SALLY.  For now, we see only
         her backside, her waist-length hair.
    
         Behind her, and closer to us, a GHOUL tips into view to
         demonstrate his particular talent:
    
                                     GHOUL
    _                      I am the guy with the tearaway face..._
    
         Sally hesitates, listening.
    
                                     GHOUL (CONT'D)
    _                      Here in a flash and gone without a trace._
    
         Sally is about to turn around, but as the ghoul vanishes, she
         continues on her way.  We follow her.
    
         In a moment, a SECOND GHOUL sets upon her -- this one more
         gruesome than the last.
    
                                     SECOND GHOUL
    _                      I am the who when you call --_
    
         This ghoul is closer, louder and Sally does turn around now --
         revealing that she's a crudely stitched together Bride Of
         Frankenstein Rag Doll.  Her balance is precarious.  Her arms
         flop.  Her mouth is a tragic slash.  She has a quavering, little
         voice:
    
                                     SALLY
    _                                              -- Who's there?_
    
         But the second ghoul has disappeared before she sees him.  Only
         his voice remains...
    
                                     SECOND GHOUL'S VOICE
    _                      I am the wind blowing through your hair._
    
         Invisible fingers lift Sally's long hair.  It is with pathetic
         eagerness that she looks around for whomever is responsible for
         this.
    
         A THIRD GHOUL
    
         springs into view, then bounces skyward.  With a very
         disappointed Sally (she's sorry he's leaving), we watch him go up
         into...
    
         EXT. SKY. NIGHT/CONTINUOUS TIME.
    
         The Third Ghoul seems to reach the moon.
    
                                     THIRD GHOUL
    _                      I am the shadow on the moon at night,
                            filling your dreams to the brim with fright._
    
         As the Third Ghoul passes the orange disk of the moon,
    
         BATS
    
         flap out from behind it.  They sing with the Third Ghoul...
    
                                     THIRD GHOUL AND BATS
    _                      This is Halloween, This is Halloween
                            HALLOWEEN!  HALLOWEEN!_
    
         The bats flutter off and the Third Ghoul falls back toward the
         ground.  He lands...
    
         EXT. HALLOWEEN TOWN SQUARE. NIGHT/CONTINUOUS TIME.
    
         As he hits the ground, the Third Ghoul shatters, breaking apart
         into several pieces -- globular and doughy GELATINOUS LUMPS, each
         a separate little creature.  When they sing, they have very high
         voices:
    
                                     GELATINOUS LUMPS
    _                      Tender Lumplings everywhere
                            Life's no fun without a good scare._
    
         Over the crest of the hill, behind the town square,
    
         THE CORPSES
    
         march into view, flanking the MAYOR'S HEARSE.
    
                                     CORPSES
    _                      That's our job, but we're not mean
                            In our town of Halloween._
    
         Behind the corpses come the VAMPIRES.
    
                                     CORPSES AND VAMPIRES
    _                      In this town --_
    
         The MAYOR
    
         blares out his message through a P.A. SYSTEM on the hearse.
    
                                     MAYOR
    _                                     -- don't we love it now?
                          Everyone's waiting for the next surprise._
    
         The WITCHES come next...
    
                                     MAYOR, CORPSES, VAMPIRES, WITCHES
    _                      Skeleton Jack might catch you in the back and
                            Scream --_
    
         The Gelatinous Lumps instantly reasemble to form the Third
         Ghoul.
    
                                     THIRD GHOUL
    _                               -- like a banshee make you jump --_
    
         The Third Ghoul immediately bounces out of sight again...
    
         SALLY
    
         stumbles into view, still hurrying.  She sings with everyone
         else...
    
                                     MAYOR, CORPSES, VAMPIRES,
                                     WITCHES, SALLY
    _                                                  -- out of your SKIN!
                          This is Halloween, --_
    
         SALLY
    
         excitedly spots someone coming -- though he's still out of view
         for us:
    
                                     SALLY
    _                                        -- Everyone scream, won't ya
                          Please make way for a special guy..._
    
         THE OTHERS
    
         turn to look.
    
                                     MAYOR, CORPSES, VAMPIRES,
                                     WITCHES, SALLY
    _                      Our man Jack is --_
    
                                     SALLY
    _                               -- King of the Pumpkin Patch._
    
                                     MAYOR, CORPSES, VAMPIRES,
                                     WITCHES, SALLY
    _                      Everyone hail to the Pumpkin King now._
    
         They part to make way for
    
         JACK SKELLINGTON, THE PUMPKIN KING,
    
         astride his SKELTON HORSE, boots set backwards in the stirrups as
         is done for the honored dead.  Jack is tall, long-limbed and
         bone-thin.  He is formally attired, and wears an elegant bat bow-
         tie.
    
         Sally gapes tragically at Jack.  But he rides right past without
         noticing her.
    
         Accompanying Jack are most of the CREATURES AND MONSTERS we've
         met, the various inhabitants of Halloweenland.  Everyone else
         falls in behind Jack -- including a stumbling, almost-left-
         behind-gawking Sally.
    
                                     EVERYONE
    _                      This is Halloween, THIS IS HALLOWEEN (etc.)_
    
         THE HANGING TREE
    
         hurries to join the parade.  He brings up the rear.  The HANGED
         MEN bobble on their ever-tightening nooses, their tongues and
         eyes popping out.
    
         The tighter nooses make the Hanged Men's voices reed-thin and
         high -- contrasting to the enormous Hanging Tree's lone _basso
         profundo_:
    
                                     HANGING TREE AND HANGED MEN
    _                      In this place we call home
                            Everyone hail to the Pumpkin Song_
    
         LATER:
    
         Jack Skellington is demonstrative and very excitable with highs
         that are extraordinarily high and lows that are unusually low.
    
         Right now he is surrounded by his ADMIRERS -- the witches in
         particular fawn over him.  Jack seems eager to please everyone,
         but, at the same time, a bit anxious to get on with it.
    
                                     JACK
                          Thank you!
    
         Sally watches htm longingly from the edge of the circle.
    
                                     MAYOR
                          Oh, Jack, you are such a
                          scream!
                              (turns to the assembly)
                          Isn't he?
    
         The assembly agrees.
    
                                     ASSEMBLY
                          Yes, he is!
    
                                     VAMPIRE
                          You make sparks fly, Jack.
    
                                     WITCH #1
                          You make oil boil.
    
                                     WITCH #2
                          You make rats shriek.
    
                                     JACK
                          I _love_ that.
    
                                     WITCH #3
                          You make flesh crawl...
    
         The three witches try to outdo one another.
    
                                     WITCH #3
                              (quickly adds)
                          ...And wounds suppurate.
    
                                     JACK
                          Thank you, thank you, thank you
                          very much!
    
         The last witch glares triumphantly at her cronies.
    
                                     THIRD GHOUL
                          What an inspiration to
                          everybody!
    
                                     SALLY
                              (echoes)
                          An inspiration...
    
                                     CORPSE
                          It was our most horrific
                          Halloween ever!
    
         Sally sighs and starts to drift irresistibly toward Jack.
         Throughout, rag doll Sally gains substance as she gains
         conviction -- this is her first baby step toward that, not even
         perceptible, but in any case RUDELY INTERRUPTED BY --
    
         THE EVIL SCIENTIST
    
         who created her.  He takes ahold of her by one of her stitched-
         together arms.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          The deadly nightshade you
                          slipped me wore off, Sally...
                          I thought I'd find you here....
    
                                     SALLY
                          No!
    
         Sally pulls back, trying to wriggle free of the scientist's
         grasp.
    
                                     SALLY
                          Let go!
    
         But he doesn't.
    
                                     SALLY
                          Have it then if you must!
    
         With her other hand, she quickly and deftly rips out the stitches
         that attach her arm to the rest of her ... THEN RIPS THE ARM
         CLEAR OUT OF ITS SOCKET.
    
         SHE LEAVES THE DOCTOR HOLDING IT WHILE SHE RUNS OFF into the the
         crowd, determined to elude the Evil Scientist.  She disappears
         into the gloom in the direction of the cemetery.
    
         Shaking her torn-off arm, the Evil Scientist calls after her:
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          You'll be back.  Sooner or
                          later you'll need this.
    
         JACK
    
         continues to congratulate and be congratulated by the various
         citizens of Halloweenland.  The Mayor interjects, looking for
         attention--
    
                                     MAYOR
                          Next year'll even be better,
                          you'll see.
    
                                     HORRIFIC-LOOKING CREATURE
                          Do you really think so, Jack?
    
                                     JACK
                          Of course I do.  It always is,
                          isn't it?
    
                                     VARIOUS MONSTERS
                          Always.
    
                                     MAYOR
                          We'll have to get on it
                          immediately.  No time for
                          sitting around smugly.
    
                                     ASSORTED MONSTERS
                          That's so true...  We've got a
                          lot of work ahead of us.
    
                                     MORE MONSTERS
                          Goodnight, everybody!
                          Goodnight, Jack!
    
         The assembly breaks up.  Jack turns to leave but his path is
         blocked by A COUPLE OF ADORABLY HIDEOUS KID MONSTERS.
    
                                     COUPLE OF KID MONSTERS
                              (plead)
                          Just one more time, Jack!
    
         Jack rattles his bones once more for the kids.  They shriek a
         gleeful shriek and scamper off.
    
         AT THE CORNER OF THE TOWN SQUARE,
    
         Jack passes a STREET BAND -- fellow skeletons down on their luck:
         an ACCORDION PLAYER, A SAX PLAYER, AND A VIOLINIST.  He tosses a
         coin into their hat.  Playing, they nod their thanks.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. CEMETERY. NIGHT/LATER.
    
         Utterly dejected, Sally crouches behind a tombstone.  She hugs
         herself with her remaining arm.
    
         THE SUDDEN SOUND OF SOMEONE APPROACHING (O.S.)
    
         makes her freeze.  She dares to peek over the top of the
         tombstone to see who it is --
    
         IT'S JACK.
    
         The sight of him immediately comforts her.
    
                                     SALLY
                          Oh... it's Jack...  Look at him
                          -- he's so alive... So happy...
                          He's so filled with confidence
                          he could teach the wolves to
                          howl!
    
         Sally lets out a little whimper of self-pity and collapses out of
         sight behind the tombstone to feel sorry for herself...
    
                                     SALLY
                          He'll never notice me.  Why
                          would he?  Why should he?
    
         Sally hugs herself again -- as best she can with her one arm.
    
         JACK
    
         makes his way past the markers and mausoleums.  He looks around
         and, since Sally is hidden behind the tombstone, he doesn't see
         anyone.  He starts the long climb up Cemetery Ridge as he sings:
    
         >>>>> _JACK'S LAMENT_
    
                                     JACK
    _                There are few who'd deny, at what I do I am the best
                          For my talents are renowned far and wide
                    When it comes to surprises in the moon-lit night,
                          I excel without ever even trying.
    
                With the slightest little effort of my ghost-like charms
                          I have seen grown men give out a shriek
                 With the wave of my hand, and a well-placed moan,
                          I have swept the very bravest off their feet._
    
         Jack pauses a moment, as if letting these facts settle in, then
         heaves a huge sigh and sags miserably.
    
         Jack's ghost dog, ZERO, rises out of his grave, floats over to
         Jack and circles around him.  Trying to comfort his beloved
         master, he drapes himself over Jack's shoulder and lays a
         sympathetic head on him.
    
         Hunched over with sorrow, Jack drags his bones on up the desolate
         hill.
    
                                     JACK
    _              Yet year after year, it's the same routine
                          And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
                  And I, Jack, the PUMPKIN KING!
                          Have grown so tired of the same old thing...._
    
         Zero drifts sadly to the ground, and flattens faithfully beside
         his master -- only his shiny little jack o'lantern nose on the
         end of his pointy snout sticks up.
    
         Jack tragically reaches the crest of the long hill.  Zero
         follows, dragging along the ground after him.
    
                                     JACK
    _              Oh somewhere deep inside of these bones
                         An emptiness began to grow
                   There's something out there far from my home
                         A longing that I've never known
                                    ... I've never known._
    
         Jack gazes hopelessly out over Halloweenland.
    
         BEHIND HER TOMBSTONE,
    
         Sally can't believe what she's hearing.  She peeks, but hides
         again.  She listens breathlessly as
    
         Jack continues his soul-searching.
    
                                     JACK
    _                I'm a master of fright, and a demon of light
                          And I'll scare you right out of your pants, boy
                    To a guy in Kentucky, I'm Mister Unlucky
                          And I'm known throughout England and France, boy
    
                    And since I am dead, I can take off my head
                          To recite Shakespearian quotations
                    No animal or man can scream like I can
                          With the fury of my recitations.
    
                    But who here would ever understand
                          That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
                    Would tire of his crown -- if they only understood
                          He would give it all up if he only could
                                              ... if he only could_
    
         SALLY'S
    
         heart goes out to Jack.  She had no idea he felt this way, no
         idea of his tragic side.  She wants to show him that he's not as
         alone as he thinks, that she understands him.  But she's timid --
         should she come out from behind the tombstone?  Dare she dare?
         Should she?  Shouldn't she?
    
                                     JACK
    _               Oh, there's an empty place in my bones
                         That calls out for something unknown
                  The fame and praise, come year after year,
                         Does nothing for these empty tears
                                      ... these empty tears...._
    
         JACK
    
         heads off with Zero, staggering away blind in his misery,
         while...
    
         SALLY,
    
         still crouched behind the tombstone, continues to debate with
         herself...
    
         Jack has left the cemetery and disappeared from sight when she
         finally screws up her courage and pops up full of determination
         and shouts:
    
                                     SALLY
                          JACK!  I KNOW YOU HARDLY KNOW
                          ME, BUT --
    
         He isn't there to hear her...  Shocked and disappointed, Sally's
         rag doll body goes floppy again.
    
         Her voice gets high and tiny... then trails off, almost
         tearfully...
    
                                     SALLY (CONT'D)
                          -- I feel the same way you
                          do...
    
         Sally stares sadly into the empty spot Jack so recently occupied,
         then turns and hobbles limply away.  She stops at a
    
         WEED-CHOKED AND DESICCATED LITTLE HERB GARDEN
    
         set beside a cluster of tombstones at the edge of the graveyard.
         The herbs growing there are labelled: "Henbane," "Witch Hazel,"
         "Deadly Night Shade."
    
         As best she can with her single arm, Sally gathers fresh sprigs
         of Deadly Night Shade.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. WILDERNESS. NIGHT/LATER.
    
         Lost in his private tragedy, Jack lurches heedlessly forward.
         Looking around confused -- they've never been here before -- Zero
         floats quickly after, hurrying to catch up.  Whimpering, he bites
         Jack's coattails and pulls -- trying his best to get Jack to
         stop, to turn around...
    
                                     JACK
                          No, Zero.
    
         Jack pulls free.
    
         Trying again, Zero grabs Jack by the leg, wrapping his mouth
         around Jack's skinny shin bone.
    
                                     JACK
                          No.  No playing today, Zero...
                          I'm just not in the mood.
    
         Zero lets go and Jack marches wretchedly forward.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. EVIL SCIENTIST'S HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT/LATER.
    
         CLOSE ON:
    
         AN EMPTY JAR MARKED "DEADLY NIGHT SHADE."
    
         SALLY
    
         drops in the fresh sprigs of the herb.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST (O.S.)
                          Sally?
    
         Alarmed, Sally screws the lid back on -- as quickly as she can
         with only one arm -- and hides the jar at the back of a cabinet.
    
         THE EVIL SCIENTIST
    
         is a twisted silhouette in the doorway behind Sally.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          You came back.
    
         Gasping guiltily, Sally spins around.
    
                                     SALLY
                          Yes.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          For this.
    
         He holds up Sally's torn-off arm -- as well as a large shiny
         needle threaded with a long strand of thread.
    
                                     SALLY
                          Yes.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          Didn't I tell you?  I'm always
                          right, you know, my dear...
                          Aren't I?
    
                                     SALLY
                          Yes.
    
         Smiling his mad grin, the scientist gestures into the room behind
         him.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          Shall we?
    
         He makes way for Sally.
    
         After a beat, Sally nods.  Resigned, she trudges past him.
    
         He jauntily follows her.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. EVIL SCIENTIST'S LABORATORY. NIGHT/LATER.
    
         The Evil Scientist carefully sews Sally's arm back on -- evenso
         the stitches are crude and the fit awkward.  The expression on
         her face is more tragic than ever.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          You're mine, you know.  I made
                          you.
    
                                     SALLY
                          I know.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          If you went away, what would
                          become of me?
    
                                     SALLY
                          I'm grown up now.  I have to
                          leave some time.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          Of course you do, and I want
                          you to... but there's no need
                          to hurry it along, is there?
    
                                     SALLY
                          I can't help it.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          That's twice this month you've
                          slipped Deadly Night Shade into
                          my tea and run off.  People
                          might get the wrong idea and
                          think you're unhappy at home.
    
         Sally whimpers sadly.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          I do the best I can to make it
                          comfortable for us here.
    
                                     SALLY
                          I know.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          But I guess my best just isn't
                          good enough.
    
         As anxious as she is to be away from here, Sally can't bear the
         thought of hurting anybody and instinctively tries to make him
         feel better.
    
                                     SALLY
                          That's not true.  It's a
                          beautiful home, wonderfully
                          comfortable... I'm indebted to
                          you for everything... It's
                          just...
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          Just what?
    
                                     SALLY
                          Just me, I suppose...  I'm
                          restless.  I can't help it.
    
         The scientist smiles, feeling Sally under his sway again.  He
         pats her consolingly, then finishes sewing on her arm and makes
         an elaborate knot at the end of his stitches.  He snips the
         thread and puts away his sewing kit.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          It's a phase, my dear.  It'll
                          pass.  We need to be patient,
                          that's all.
    
         Sally heaves a big sigh.
    
                                     SALLY
                          That's all....
    
         She looks off tragically.  Outside, it's sunrise.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. FOREST. DAWN.
    
         Still bowed by the depth of his despair, unaware of time, or
         distance, or anything, Jack wanders through the gloom of the
         forest.  Zero floats protectively at his side.
    
         Suddenly, Jack is stabbed by a ray of light from the rising sun.
    
                                     JACK
                          Ow!
    
         Cringing, he stops in his tracks.  When he dares to look around
         him, it is as though he has just been woken up from a dream.
    
                                     JACK
                          Where am I?
    
         Zero barks his haunted ghost bark.  Jack seems to notice the dog.
    
                                     JACK
                          Zero!  Where are we?  We've
                          never been here, have we, boy?
    
         Jack takes a few steps one direction and looks curiously, then a
         few steps in another direction and looks -- and looks.
    
                                     JACK
                          It's some place new.
    
         Zero circles Jack, whirling him around, trying to aim him back
         toward home.  But Jack resists.  He wants to see whatever there
         is to see.
    
         He proceeds deeper into the woods.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. JACK'S TOWER. DAY.
    
         The Mayor's hearse pulls up in front of Jack's tower.  The Mayor
         climbs out, arms brimming with blueprints and plans.  He struts
         to Jack's door -- his self-confident face on -- and bangs the
         knocker.
    
                                     MAYOR
                          Jack?!
    
         He waits for an answer.  There isn't any.  Even this little bit
         of suspense brings out the Mayor's other face -- this one is
         scared, self-doubting.
    
                                     MAYOR
                          Jack?!  You home?!
    
         There's still no answer.
    
         The mayor squints out into the street.  Clearing his throat, he
         barks confidently at PASSERS-BY:
    
                                     MAYOR
                               (to various passers-
                                by)
                          Have you seen Jack?...  Have
                          you seen Jack?...
    
         But nobody has.  He doesn't bother to ask the Street Band set up
         across the street.
    
         The mayor's bravado face evaporates and the whiny one takes over.
    
                                     MAYOR
                          Where is he?  We had an
                          appointment.
    
         His blustery face back on, the Mayor shouts up to Jack's room at
         the top of the tower.
    
                                     MAYOR
                          Jack?!  I've got the plans for
                          next year!  See?!
    
         He holds up the blueprints and plans he carries.
    
                                     MAYOR
                          I need to go over them with you
                          so we can get started!
                          Halloween'll be here again in
                          no time!  Three hundred and
                          sixty odd days fly by too fast!
    
         The Mayor's faces alternate in progressively rapid succession as
         panic sets in.
    
                                     MAYOR
                               (shouts desperately)
                          Jack!  Please!  I'm only an
                          elected official here!  I can't
                          make decisions!  Jack!  Answer
                          me!
    
         Ruined, the Mayor crumples.
    
         The ACCORDION PLAYER of the Street Band says quietly from across
         the street:
    
                                     ACCORDION PLAYER
                          He can't.
    
         The Mayor looks up.
    
                                     MAYOR
                          Why not?
    
                                     ACCORDION PLAYER
                          He's not home.
    
                                     MAYOR
                          Where is he?
    
                                     ACCORDION PLAYER
                          He hasn't been home all night.
    
         The Mayor tries to rouse himself, but he's shorted out,
         exhausted...
    
                                     MAYOR
                               (feebly)
                          Oh...
    
         He drops again to the sidewalk.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. EVIL SCIENTIST'S HOUSE. DAY/LATER.
    
         Sally peers out of an upper-storey window -- expression eager and
         despairing at once.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. FOREST. DUSK.
    
         It is just before night.  Jack strides forward toward a
    
         DISTANT PUMPKIN SHAPE
    
         that seems to be carved out of the dark and outlined by glowing
         light.
    
         Jack can't wait to find out what it means, but Zero, warier than
         his master and far less enthusiastic about this adventure, lags
         behind.
    
         Arriving at the Pumpkin shape, Jack eagerly reaches out to it.
         When he touches it, it gives -- CREAKING OPEN to more woods
         beyond.  It's a DOOR.
    
         Zero hurries to catch up as Jack steps through the Pumpkin-shaped
         Door and out into a
    
         CLEARING
    
         in this next forest.  Awed, Jack stops dead in the middle of the
         clearing and gapes at what he sees -- there are
    
         MORE DOORWAYS
    
         etched into the trunks of the trees that ring the clearing.  To
         us, these doorways make sense -- one is shaped like an EASTER
         EGG, another like a FIRECRACKER, another like a VALENTINE,
         another like a SHAMROCK, and another like a CHRISTMAS TREE.  To
         Jack, who's never heard of the other holidays, these doorways are
         a total mystery.
    
         He is especially TRANSFIXED by the
    
         CHRISTMAS TREE-SHAPED DOOR.
    
         It rattles invitingly on its hinges.  Gusts of cold air blow out
         from behind it.  Snow oozes out beneath.  The drama of it draws
         Jack closer.
    
         Zero hesitates in the Pumpkin-shaped doorway, uneasy about
         crossing through it to the other side -- but the sight of Jack,
         striding resolutely toward the Christmas Tree-shaped door, makes
         him swoop quickly after.
    
         Using all his strength, Jack wrenches open the Christmas Tree-
         shaped door.  There is a moment's delay -- darkness, stillness,
         silence -- then the instantaneous fury of a
    
         HOWLING BLIZZARD.
    
         A quick blast of snow knocks Zero clear back through the Pumpkin-
         shaped doorway.
    
         The whipping winter wind curls around Jack's frail bones and
         SUCKS HIM IN THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR.  Jack disappears.  The
         Christmas Tree-shaped door SLAMS SHUT.
    
         After a beat:
    
         Zero pokes his head up over the lintel of the Pumpkin-shaped
         doorway and sees that Jack has vanished.  Panic-stricken, he
         streaks across the clearing to the closed Christmas Tree door.
    
         Crying, he scratches on the door, tries to squeeze under it (his
         vaporous body is easy, but his head and jack o'lantern nose are
         another matter), circles the tree, investigates for another
         entrance (above, below, every which way).  He tries everything in
         his ghost-dog powers to get in -- but all in vain.  He has no
         choice but to wait.  Ears cocked, he settles down to stare and
         stare at the strange door that swallowed his master....
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         THE WHIRLING, SNOW-SWIRLING TUNNEL OF BLACKNESS
    
         through which Jack FALLS.  The fall abruptly ends.  BLACK.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. CHRISTMASTOWN. NIGHT.
    
         Jack sits up in the snow bank where he has landed.  He looks
         excitedly around.  He marvels first at the miracle of snow.
    
         >>>>> _WHAT'S THIS?_
    
                                     JACK
    _                      What's this?  What's this?
                          There's color everywhere... What's this?
                          There's white things in the air... What's this?
                          I can't believe my eyes I must be dreaming,
                          Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair... What's this?_
    
         He cavorts excitedly in the snow, slipping and sliding and
         finally tumbling down a hill into the center of Christmastown.
         He springs up, shakes himself off, and enthusiastically explores
         the snow-blanketed village.
    
                                     JACK (CONT'D)
    _                      What's this?  What's this?
                          There's something very wrong... What's this?
                          There're people singing songs... What's this?
                          The streets are lined with
                          Little creatures laughing,
                          Everybody seems so happy,
                          Have I possibly gone daffy...?
                          What is this...?  What's this?
    
                          There're children throwing snowballs
                          Here instead of throwing heads.
                          They're busy building toys
                          And absolutely no one's dead._
    
         Here in Christmastown, every tree is a Christmas tree and each
         house is shinier and more beautifully decorated than the next.
    
                                     JACK (CONT'D)
    _                      There's frost on every window,
                          Oh, I can't believe my eyes,
                          And in my bones I feel a warmth
                          That's coming from inside..._
    
         Jack peeks into warmly-lighted homes...  Jack uses his consummate
         Halloween trickster skills to see without being seen...
    
                                     JACK (CONT'D)
    _                      Oh, look, what's this?
                          They're hanging mistletoe... They kiss --
                          Why that looks so unique... Inspired!
                          They're gathering around to hear a story,
                          Roasting chestnuts on a fire...  What's this?
    
                          What's this?  In here
                          They've got a little tree... how queer!
                          And who would ever think... and why?
                          They're covering it with
                          Tiny little things, they've got
                          Electric lights on strings, and there's a
                          Smile on everyone, so now
                          Correct me if I'm wrong...
                          This looks like fun,
                          This looks like fun,
                          Oh, could it be I got my wish...?  What's this?_
    
         Jack enters the CHILDRENS' cozy BEDROOM in one house...
    
                                     JACK (CONT'D)
    _                      Oh my, what now?
                          The children are asleep...  But look --
                          There's nothing underneath...  No ghouls
                          No witches here to scream and scare them
                                            ... or ensnare them...
                          Only cozy little things
                          Secure inside their dreamland...  What's this?_
    
         Distracted, Jack goes off to leave the child at whom he has been
         peering suddenly wide awake and terrified...
    
         Jack is back outside...
    
                                     JACK (CONT'D)
    _                      The monsters are all missing
                          And the nightmares can't be found
                          And in their place there seems to be
                          Good feeling all around...
    
                          Instead of screams I swear I can hear
                          Music in the air.
                          The smell of cakes and pies
                          Is absolutely everywhere...
    
                          The sights, the sounds,
                          They're everywhere and all around...
                          I've never felt so good before...
                          The empty place inside of me is filling up
                          I simply cannot get enough.
                          I want it, oh, I want it...
                          Oh, I want it for my own.
                          I've got to know
                          I've got to know
                          What is this place that I have found?
    
                          WHAT IS THIS???_
    
         Jack darts this way and that and runs and runs, trying to get his
         fill of this strange new wonderful place.
    
         He trips and falls and starts to roll and as he rolls he gathers
         snow -- he becomes a gigantic snowball barrelling through
         Christmas town, stopping only when he SLAMS INTO
    
         ONE OF TWO GIGANTIC CANDY CANES...
    
         between which spans a sign.  Jack bursts out of his snow ball
         only to have fresh snow dumped on him which falls from the sign
         between the two tall candy canes.
    
         Jack shakes himself free of this fresh heap of snow, looks up at
         the wide welcoming sign:
    
                              CHRISTMASTOWN
    
         And thoughtfully reads...
    
                                     JACK
    _                      .... Christmastown?  Hmmmmmmmm._
    
         Jack studies the town from this distance -- the lights glow
         heart-warmingly.
    
                                     JACK
                          Incredible.  I'll need proof...
    
         On his feet again, he slinks quietly back toward Christmastown.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. HALLOWEEN TOWN SQUARE. DAY.
    
         A number of the worried citizens of Halloweenland have gathered.
         They chatter among themselves.  The MAYOR addresses them from the
         top of his hearse.
    
                                     MAYOR
                          Quiet.  Quiet now.  We all
                          agree that two days is far too
                          long for Jack to have been gone
                          without warning...  Is there
                          anywhere we've forgotten to
                          check?
    
                                     MONSTER WITH THE TEAR-AWAY FACE
                          I looked in every mausoleum.
    
                                     TWO WITCHES
                               (in unison)
                          We opened the sarcophagi.
    
                                     BLIND-FOLDED, EXECUTED MAN
                          I tromped through the Pumpkin
                          Patch.
    
                                     VAMPIRE
                          I peeked behind the Cyclops'
                          eye.
    
         The other citizens wheel around to look at him disbelievingly.
    
                                     VAMPIRE
                               (defensively)
                          I did!...
                               (then adds sadly)
                          But he wasn't there...
    
         Everyone sighs.
    
                                     MAYOR
                          It's time to sound the
                          alarms...
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. EVIL SCIENTIST'S KITCHEN. DAY/LATER
    
         Outside, the alarms wail in the distance while, inside, Sally
         speedily whips up a pot of sleeping-potion soup.
    
         She keeps looking out the window, hoping for a hint of what's
         going on, but nothing -- not a clue.  Eager to find out, she
         hurries the soup along...
    
         Various spice jars are out on the counter -- among them, the one
         labelled "Deadly Night Shade," the entire contents of which she
         dumps into the pot.
    
                                     SALLY
                               (to herself)
                          Regular dose...  Double dose...
                          Double, double dose.  He'll be
                          able to smell a double, double
                          dose of Deadly Night Shade...
                          Anybody could.
    
         She studies the other jars and picks the one labelled "Frog's
         Breath."
    
                                     SALLY (CONT'D)
                          Frog's Breath will overpower
                          any smell.
    
         She opens the jar.  Recoiling from the odor, she turns aside,
         trying to escape the fumes as she pours some of the Frog's Breath
         into the soup -- but it starts to overwhelm her anyway.  She
         swoons.  Her knees buckle.
    
         In her swoon, she fumbles blindly among the other jars.
    
                                     SALLY
                               (choking)
                          Sweet Pea...  Where's that
                          Sweet Pea...  Too bitter...
                          Too bitter...
    
         Her hand finally locates the jar labelled, "Sweet Pea."
    
         The Evil Scientist calls from another room:
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST (O.S.)
                          Sally?
    
         Still choking, hardly able even to squeak out an answer, Sally
         struggles to open the Sweet Pea jar.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST (O.S.)
                          Where's my soup?
    
         Sally finally gets the jar open.  As fast as she can, she empties
         it into the soup and hovers above the pot.  In a moment, the
         Sweet Pea takes effect and Sally's strength begins to return.
    
                                     SALLY
                               (gasps)
                          Coming...
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST (O.S.)
                          Good.  I'm hungry.
    
         Still a bit shaky, Sally reaches for one more jar.  The label on
         this one reads, "Worm's Wart."
    
                                     SALLY
                               (hoarsely)
                          A handful of Worm's Wart just
                          for distraction.  It'll throw
                          him off the trail for sure...
    
         She drops in some Worm's Wart, stirs the soup, then ladles out a
         bowlful.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. EVIL SCIENTIST'S LABORATORY. DAY.
    
         The Evil Scientist is at his lab table, peering into a microscope
         and thinking -- which, for him, involves lifting off the top of
         his skull and tickling and scrambling the brains inside.
    
         Sally carries in a tray holding his bowl of soup.
    
                                     SALLY
                          Lunch.
    
         The scientist impatiently gestures her over.  He replaces the top
         of his skull...
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          Excellent.  Over here.  Over
                          here.  Set it down.
    
         She gingerly sets the tray in front of him.
    
         The scientist inhales a deep sniff of the steam curling off the
         soup.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          Ah...  What's that?...  Worm's
                          Wart!
    
         He glances suspiciously at Sally.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          What trail are you trying to
                          throw me off now?
    
                                     SALLY
                               (stammers; feigns
                                innocence)
                          Nothing.  W-w-what are you
                          talking about?
    
         The scientist pushes the bowl of soup toward Sally.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          Taste it.
    
                                     SALLY
                          But why?  It's _your_ lunch.
                          There isn't much there in the
                          first place.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          Taste it.
    
                                     SALLY
                          No.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          Why not?
    
                                     SALLY
                          I'm not hungry.
                               (acts all hurt)
                          What's wrong?  I spent all
                          morning on that soup.  I
                          thought you liked Worm's Wart.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          There's nothing more suspicious
                          than Worm's Wart -- it
                          distracts one from every other
                          taste and smell.
    
         He dips a spoon into the soup then holds it up to Sally.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          Until _you_ taste it, _I_ won't eat
                          a bite.
    
         Sally crumples.
    
                                     SALLY
                          But I have to go out.
                          Something's happening out
                          there.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          Whatever it is, it's none of
                          your concern.
    
         He waves the spoon at her.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          Eat.
    
         She keeps her lips closed tight.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                               (lapses into self-pity
                                mode)
                          Then we'll both starve...  An
                          old man like me, who hardly has
                          strength as it is -- me,
                          without whom... me, your own
                          father...
    
                                     SALLY
                          Can't you make other creations?
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          I could.  Of course I could.
                          But no one would be like you...
                               (pours it on again)
                          I'll never understand how you
                          can be so cold-hearted, how you
                          can treat me this way,
                          discarding me like--
    
         It works.  He wears Sally down:
    
                                     SALLY
                               (interrupts)
                          All right...  All right...
                          I'll eat it.
    
         She closes her eyes and sips the soup off the spoon.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. TOWN SQUARE. DUSK.
    
         The Mayor lies sprawled on top of his hearse, staring up at the
         sky for ideas.  He's exhausted, as are the assembled citizens of
         Halloweenland, exhausted from exhausting their alternatives when
         it comes to seeking Jack.
    
         The Mayor lifts his heavy head and feebly asks:
    
                                     MAYOR
                          Did anybody think to dredge the
                          lake?
    
         A recumbent corpse sits up and nods:
    
                                     CORPSE
                          This morning.
    
         The corpse flops down again.
    
         The mayor lets his head fall back.
    
         IN THE DISTANCE,
    
         there's a BARK (O.S.)
    
                                     WITCH #1
                          Hear that?
    
                                     WITCH #2
                          What?
    
         Now a DEEP RUMBLING (O.S.) can just be heard -- punctuated by
         another sharp BARK (O.S.)
    
                                     WITCH #3
                          Ssh!
    
         They listen.  More RUMBLING.  DEFINITE BARKS NOW.
    
                                     VAMPIRE
                               (excited)
                          Zero?!
    
         The sounds get louder, closer...
    
         The group revives.  The mayor sits up.  Before long...
    
         AROUND THE CORNER
    
         comes an ecstatic Jack driving a jaunty, Christmasland SNOW
         MOBILE, heavily laden with Christmasland memorabilia.  A joyous
         Zero loops-the-loop around his master.
    
                                     MAYOR AND VARIOUS CITIZENS
                          Look!  It's Jack!
    
                                     JACK
                          I'M BACK!
    
         The Halloweenland citizens gape.
    
                                     VAMPIRE
                          Where've you been?
    
                                     JACK
                          I can't wait to tell all of you
                          all about it!
                               (to the Mayor)
                          Mayor!  Call us a town meeting!
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. HALLOWEEN STREETS. EVENING.
    
         The Mayor's hearse glides through town, p.a. system blaring:
    
                                     MAYOR'S AMPLIFIED VOICE
                          Town meeting!  Town meeting
                          tonight!
    
         The hearse passes the
    
         DESERTED GOTHIC MANSE.
    
         Out stream the Creatures, Corpses, and other Vampires.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. CEMETERY. EVENING.
    
         As the hearse passes and the announcement is heard, the
         GRAVESTONES open.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. MORE HALLOWEEN STREETS. EVENING.
    
         The hearse threads through town past the EVIL SCIENTIST'S HOUSE.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. EVIL SCIENTIST'S LABORATORY. EVENING/SAME TIME.
    
         Sally and the Evil Scientist are both asleep -- the Evil
         scientist snores, his head on the lab table beside the now empty
         bowl; Sally has fallen asleep on her way through the doorway --
         hat on, arm half-way into the sleeve of her coat.
    
                                     MAYOR'S AMPLIFIED VOICE (O.S.)
                          Town meeting!  Town meeting
                          tonight!
    
         Neither of them hears the announcement.  Neither of them stirs.
         Their deep sleep goes on undisturbed.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. TOWN HALL. NIGHT.
    
         The town hall is a tilted Chautauqua meetinghouse.  We HEAR the
         noise of the crowd inside and see a few Halloweenland latecomers
         hurry in.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. TOWN HALL. NIGHT.
    
         Jack stands at a podium on a stage at the end of the big meeting
         hall.  Set up beside him is a table piled high with (at this
         point) non-descripit objects.
    
         The murmuring crowd presses close to the stage.  Of course, Sally
         and the Evil Scientist are absent.
    
         Jack holds up his hands for attention.
    
                                     JACK
                          Listen everyone.  I want to
                          tell you about where I've been!
    
         He sings:
    
         >>>>> _THE TOWN MEETING SONG_
    
                                     JACK
    _                      There were objects so peculiar
                          They were not to be believed
                          All around things to tantalize my brain.
                          It's a world unlike anything I've ever seen
                          And as hard as I try...
                          I can't seem to describe
                          Like a most improbable dream...
    
                          But you must believe when I tell you this
                          It's as real as my skull, and it does exist._
    
         Turning to sort through the objects on the table, Jack speaks:
    
                                     JACK
                          Here...  Let me show you.
    
         The people press even closer.
    
                                     PEOPLE
                          Ohhhh....
    
         Jack holds up a wrapped gift:
    
                                     JACK
    _                      This is a thing called a present.
                          The whole thing starts with a box..._
    
                                     VARIOUS PEOPLE
    _                      -- A box?
                          --        Is it steel?
                          --                     Are there locks?
                          -- Is it filled with a pox?
                          --                          A pox!
                          -- How delightful, a pox!_
    
         Jack interrupts their excited babbling:
    
                                     JACK
                          If you please!!!
    
         He sings on:
    
                                     JACK
    _                      Just a box with bright colored paper
                          And the whole thing topped with a bow._
    
                                     VARIOUS PEOPLE
    _                      -- A bow?
                          --        But why?
                          --                  How ugly!
                          -- What's in it?
                          --                What's in it?_
    
                                     JACK
    _                      That's the point of the thing, not to know!_
    
                                     VARIOUS PEOPLE
    _                      -- It's a bat.
                          --              Will it bend?
                          -- It's a rat.
                          --              Will it break?
                          -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake._
    
                                     JACK
    _                      Listen now, you don't understand.
                          That's not the point of Christmasland._
    
         Jack shakes his finger at them:
    
                                     JACK
                          Now, pay attention.
    
         He takes a Christmas stocking off his display table and sings
         again:
    
                                     JACK
    _                      Now we pick up an oversized sock...
                          And bang it like this on the wall._
    
         The irrepressible crowd bubbles over again:
    
                                     VARIOUS PEOPLE
    _                      -- Oh yes, does it still have a foot?
                          -- Let me see...
                          --                Let me look...
                          -- Is it rotted and covered with gook?_
    
         Jack is getting very frustrated:
    
                                     JACK
                          Let me explain.
    
         But to no avail...
    
                                     VARIOUS PEOPLE
    _                      -- Small toys?
                          --             Do they bite?
                          --                           Do they snap?
                          -- Or perhaps they just spring out and
                             Scare girls and boys._
    
         The Mayor struts to the front of the audience.
    
                                     MAYOR
    _                      What a splendid idea --
                          This Christmas sounds fun.
                          Why I fully endorse it!
                          Let's try it at once!_
    
         But doubt immediately overtakes the Mayor as Jack expresses his
         exasperation with the way things are going...
    
                                     JACK
    _                      Everyone, please, now not so fast.
                          There's something here that you don't quite grasp._
    
         Confident face evaporating, the Mayor skulks off.
    
         Jack looks down at the faces tipped up toward him -- in the
         expressions, puzzlement replaces eagerness.
    
                                     JACK
                               (to himself)
                          Well, I may as well give them
                          what they want.
    
         Jack picks up his song again -- the showman once more:
    
                                     JACK
    _                      And the best, I must confess,
                            I have saved for the last
                          For the ruler of this Christmasland...
                            Is a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice
                          Least, that is what I've come to understand.
    
                          And I've also heard it told
                          That he's something to behold
                          Like a lobster, huge and red...
                          And sets out to slay with his raingear on,
                          Carting bulging sacks with his big great arms...
                          That is, so I've heard it said._
    
         Listening to this, the people of Halloweenland are absolutely
         spellbound, rapt, and quiet for a change.
    
                                     JACK (CONT'D)
    _                      And on a dark, cold night
                            Under full moonlight
                          He flies off into a fog
                            Like a vulture in the sky...
                          And they call him -- Sandy Claws._
    
         At this conclusion, a delightful shudder runs through the
         audience.
    
                                     CROWD
                          OOOOH....
    
         They erupt into giddy chatter.
    
         Jack watches them from the stage, then turns to his display table
         and begins gathering up his many Christmasland souvenirs.
    
                                     JACK
                               (sings wistfully to
                                himself)
    _                      Well, at least they're excited,
                          But they don't understand
                          That special kind of feeling
                               ... In Christmasland._
    
         Jack shakes a Frosty the Snowman paper weight and dreamily
         watches the little snowflakes drift down.
    
                                     JACK
    _                      Oh well...._
    
         Sighing, he packs his treasures.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. JACK'S TOWER. NIGHT.
    
         Jack happily decorates his room with the Christmasland souvenirs.
    
         -- He festoons the electric chair with boughs of holly and a
         sprig of mistletoe atop the confining head cap.
    
         -- He tosses wreaths around the necks of the gargoyles that leer
         down from corners of the ceiling.
    
         -- He ties a red bow on Zero.
    
         LATER,
    
         in bed, snuggled down, wearing a nightcap, his pile of Christmas
         books beside him, Jack gazes critically around his room.  It is
         over-bright with electric lights -- they're strung everywhere
         they can be strung.  Tinsel sparkles glaringly.
    
         Lips pursed, Jack climbs out of bed to pull a string of lights
         out behind an obscuring cobweb, then isn't satisfied just to see
         them, but traces the intricate pattern of the cobweb with them.
         He steps back for perspective, comes forward to make an
         adjustment, steps back to look again...  He frowns.  He scratches
         his head.
    
                                     JACK
                          It's not quite right;
                          something's wrong... But
                          what?...
    
         He paces and looks, paces and looks -- but the mystery remains a
         mystery.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. EVIL SCIENTIST'S HOUSE. DAY.
    
         Still suffering the effects of her own sleeping potion, a
         disheveled Sally drags through the house.
    
         The DOORBELL RINGS (O.S.).
    
         Sally turns sluggishly.
    
                                     SALLY
                               (slowly)
                          Who could that be?
    
         She shuffles toward it.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. EVIL SCIENTIST'S FRONT DOOR. DAY/MOMENTS LATER.
    
         Sally drags open the front door.  There, on the front stoop, to
         her utter astonishment stands
    
         JACK.
    
         He has on a cheery face, but it is obvious to her that he is
         disturbed.
    
                                     JACK
                          Good morning.
    
                                     SALLY
                               (voice little)
                          Y-you don't have to say that.
                          You don't need to pretend.  Not
                          with me.
    
         He looks quizzically at her.
    
                                     JACK
                          Is the doctor in?
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST (O.S.)
                               (calls)
                          Who is it, Sally?
    
         Answering for her, Jack strides right in:
    
                                     JACK
                               (calls to the doctor)
                          It's Jack Skellington.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST (O.S.)
                               (calls)
                          Jack!  What a surprise, my boy,
                          a rare pleasure indeed.  Come
                          on back... I'm in the
                          laboratory.
    
         Jack heads back.  Sally looks tragically after.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. JACK'S TOWER. DUSK.
    
         Jack intently sets up a make-shift laboratory with equipment
         borrowed from the Evil Scientist -- a microscope, mortar and
         pestle, petri dishes, a centrifuge, test tubes, beakers already
         filled with steaming liquid.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. EVIL SCIENTIST'S LABORATORY. NIGHT.
    
         As Sally shuffles timidly into the room, the scientist doesn't
         look up from his reading.
    
                                     SALLY
                               (blurts)
                          Jack Skellington was here this
                          morning.
    
         The scientist nods without looking up:
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          Uh-huh.
    
                                     SALLY
                          He stayed a long time.
    
         The scientist nods again.
    
                                     SALLY
                          When he left, he took a lot of
                          equipment with him.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          He's conducting experiments of
                          his own.
    
                                     SALLY
                          Experiments?
    
         Suddenly afraid for Jack, Sally wheels around and stumbles OUT
         INTO THE
    
         HALL
    
         and UP THE
    
         RICKETY STAIRS.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. SALLY'S ROOM. NIGHT/MOMENTS LATER.
    
         Sally rushes in and hurries across to her window.  She stands on
         tip-toe and strains to peer out.  In the distance, between two
         other buildings, she can just MAKE OUT A CORNER OF
    
         JACK'S TOWER.
    
         A strange glow emanates from there.
    
         Sally stares for a long time, biting her lip with worry, then
         decisively:
    
         Sally turns to her desk.  She takes out a piece of paper and a
         pen and writes, reading aloud as she goes:
    
                                     SALLY
                          Dear Doctor...  Please don't
                          come after me again.  Please
                          let me go this time.  I am all
                          grown up and need to find my
                          own life now.  I hope you will
                          understand, some day at least.
                          Signed -- Sally.  P.S. I'll
                          come visit very soon.  P.P.S.
                          There's fresh soup in the
                          'fridge.  P.P.P.S. It isn't
                          spiked.
    
         She adds some x's and o's to the bottom of the letter, then sets
         it on the pillow of her bed where the doctor will be sure to find
         it.
    
         She takes a needle and spool of thread out of her drawer, stuffs
         them into her dress, then without warning,
    
         JUMPS OUT HER WINDOW
    
         with suicidal abandon.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. EVIL SCIENTIST'S HOUSE. NIGHT/CONTINUOUS TIME.
    
         Sally lands on the street outside -- sprawled, torn apart,
         stuffing flowing out, stitches burst.
    
         In a moment, she flops upright.  She pulls out the needle, the
         thread, threads the needle and, glancing every so often over her
         shoulder at the Evil Scientist's house, hurriedly proceeds to sew
         herself back together again.
    
         The job done.  She stashes the needle and thread and wobbly (her
         stitches are looser than the doctor's) gets to her feet to go --
         only she's sewed one of her legs on backwards -- so that when she
         takes a step, her legs walk in opposite directions and she falls
         right over.
    
         She lets out a little moan of frustration.  Swivelling, she looks
         back at the house, afraid of getting caught...
    
         She works even faster now, ripping out the stitches on the leg
         she replaced backwards and basting it back on facing forwards.
    
         These stitches are really huge and ungainly.  Still, they're
         substantial enough to allow her to get to her feet and totter
         away, though limping rather badly.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. JACK'S TOWER. SUNRISE.
    
         Jack has worked through the night and continues to work,
         concentrated, intent, doing his methodical best to study
         Christmas.
    
         -- He stares at an image of Sandy Claws he's drawn on the
         chalkboard -- with giant red lobster hand and elaborate
         raingear -- then erases it.
    
         -- He leafs back and forth through the Christmas books, every so
         often stopping briefly on an image -- RUDOLF, THE RED-NOSED
         REINDEER OR FROSTY, THE SNOWMAN OR AN ANNOTATED ILLUSTRATION OF
         "THE STOCKINGS ARE HUNG BY THE CHIMNEY WITH CARE."
    
         -- He scrapes a little bit of the shininess off a Christmas tree
         ball.  With a mortar and pestle, he grinds the flake of shininess
         to a sparkling powder, then sprinkles the powder over himself as
         if it were fairy dust.  He strikes a pose and waits -- but no
         transformation occurs.  In another beat, he turns back to his
         work table, freshly determined.
    
                                     JACK
                          Sooner or later this Christmas
                          will yield up its secrets to
                          me.  I'll crack it!  I will!
    
         -- He studies a strand of tinsel under the microscope.  It
         reflects his own hollow eye socket back to him.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. JACK'S TOWER. DAY.
    
         Hiding in the shadows of the building across the street, Sally
         stares up at Jack's room.
    
         She pulls back out of sight once -- when the Evil Scientist
         passes, obviously looking for her -- but steps out again as soon
         as he's gone.
    
         Other citizens of Halloween look up at Jack's windows as they
         pass and shake their heads with concern, but only Sally keeps a
         vigil.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. JACK'S TOWER. DAY/LATER.
    
         Jack stands at the chalkboard where he's scribbled elaborate
         formulae: Good Cheer + Roasting Chestnuts + Sandy Claws =
         Christmas Fun.  Sugar Plums + Christmas trees + Rudolf, the Red-
         Nosed Reindeer = Christas Fun.  Presents + Mistletoe + Snowballs
         = Christmas Fun.  If A = B and B = C and A = C, then what isn't
         D?
    
         He feverishly crosses out some phrases, corrects others,
         substitutes, modifies.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. JACK'S TOWER. DUSK.
    
         Using a pulley, Sally surreptitiously hoists up a basket of food.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. JACK'S TOWER. DUSK/CONTINUOUS TIME.
    
         A TOY STEAM ENGINE
    
         now chugs along tracks laid around the perimeter of Jack's room.
         Puffing smoke, it hauls a string of open cars filled with
         Christmas dolls and toys.  Jack adds more toys as the tiny train
         cars pass him.
    
         He looks up at the ODD SCRAPING SOUND of Sally's food basket
         knocking against the window.
    
         AT THE WINDOW,
    
         he unhooks the basket and lifts it in.  Inside is dinner,
         lovingly wrapped in a napkin -- a skeleton chicken, a couple of
         apple cores, and a cold bottle of newt juice.
    
         Jack leans
    
         OUT THE WINDOW
    
         to see who sent this to him.  His gaze locks with Sally's -- far
         below.  A beat.  He nods his thanks.  She waves -- slowly, in
         tragic sympathy.  He pulls back into his tower.
    
         ON THE GROUND,
    
         Sally keeps staring faithfully up at Jack's window.
    
         IN HIS TOWER,
    
         Jack dances around a Christmas tree, giddily tossing on
         decorations.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. JACK'S TOWER. NIGHT.
    
         Sally is back at her post across the street, watching
    
         JACK'S WINDOW
    
         where a TALL CANDLE BURNS.
    
         AS IF IN TIME-LAPSE, the candle burns all the way down while the
         NIGHT PASSES INTO
    
         EXT. JACK'S TOWER. DAY.
    
         Sally sleeps curled in the doorway across the street.  She wakes
         to
    
         A SMALL CROWD
    
         gathering beneath Jack's window.
    
         >>>>> _JACK'S OBSESSION_
    
                                     TWO VAMPIRES
                               (quietly sing)
    _           Something's up with Jack, something's up with Jack..._
    
         A THIRD VAMPIRE adds his voice...
    
                                     THREE VAMPIRES
    _              Don't know if we're ever going to get him back._
    
         Flanked by two corpses, a SLATHERING BEAST lumbers up, singing...
    
                                     SLATHERING BEAST
    _           He's all alone up there, locked away inside..._
    
         The CORPSE on his right joins in...
    
                                     BEAST AND CORPSE
    _              Never says a word..._
    
         Then BOTH CORPSES and the beast sing...
    
                                     BEAST AND TWO CORPSES
    _                                   ... hope he hasn't died..._
    
         Then the whole crowd sings...
    
                                     CROWD
    _           Something's up with Jack...
                          ... Something's up with Jack...
                                      ... Something's up with Jack..._
    
         Sally stays back, separate from the crowd, silent.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. TOWER. DAY/SAME TIME.
    
         Jack stands in the center of his room, a demon possessed,
         surrounded by Christmas mayhem -- the glittery decorations and
         toys and books strewn all about him.
    
         He sings:
    
                                     JACK
    _                      Christmastime is buzzing in my skull.
                          Will it let me be?  I cannot tell.
                          There're so many things I cannot grasp...
                          When I think I've got it, then at last
                          Through my bony fingers it does slip
                          Like a snowflake in a fiery grip.
    
                          Something's here I'm not quite getting
                          Though I try, I keep forgetting
                          Like a memory long since past
                          Here in an instant, gone in a flash...
                          What does it mean?  What does it mean?
    
                          In these little bric-a-brac,
                          A secret waiting to be cracked.
                          These dolls and toys confuse me so...
                          Confound it all -- I love it though!
    
                          Simple objects nothing more
                          But something's hidden through the door.
                          Though I do not have the key,
                          Something's there I cannot see.
                          What does it mean?  What does it mean?
    
                          I've read these Christmas books so many times
                          I know the stories and I know the rhymes
                          I know the Christmas carols all by heart...
                          My skull's so full, it's tearing me apart.
                          As often as I read them, something's wrong...
                          So hard to put my bony finger on..._
    
         A thought strikes Jack.  He takes a new tack...  He whirls
         around, singing...
    
                                     JACK (CONT'D)
    _                      Or perhaps it's really not as
                          Deep as I've been led to think.
                          Am I trying much too hard...?
                          Of course!  I've been too close to see!
                          The answer's right in front of me!
    
                          It's simple really, very clear,
                          Like music drifting in the air
                          Invisible but everywhere.
                          Just because I cannot see it
                          Doesn't mean I can't believe it._
    
         Enthusiasm takes the place of torment.  Joy lightens Jack's
         tortured soul.
    
                                     JACK (CONT'D)
    _                      You know I think this Christmas thing --
                            It's not as tricky as it seems.
                          And why should they have all the fun?
                            It should belong to anyone...
                          Not anyone, in fact, but me!
                            Why, _I_ could make a Christmas tree.
                          And there's no reason I can find
                            That I couldn't handle Christmastime.
    
                          I bet I could improve it too!
                            And that's exactly what I'll do!_
    
         Jack hurries to the window and throws it open.
    
                                     JACK
                               (shouts out)
                          EUREKA!
    
         BELOW,
    
         the crowd is relieved.
    
                                     CROWD
                          Ahhh....
    
         They smile up at their beloved Skeleton Jack.  All except for
         Sally.
    
                                     SALLY
                               (sadly to herself)
                          Oh Jack...  Now what fever has
                          engulfed you?  Your poor
                          sensitive mind...
    
         Sally stares up at him...
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. TOWN HALL. DAY.
    
         A LINE of waiting Halloweeners extends out the entrance doors.
         The word, 'Christmas,' buzzes in the air.
    
         Sally stands in line with everyone else -- somewhere near the
         back, just behind the members of the Street Band.  She practices
         what she's going to say to Jack when it's her turn --
    
                                     SALLY
                               (whispers almost
                                inaudibly to herself)
                          Jack, you must let go of this
                          insanity.  Don't make this
                          mistake.  Taking over Christmas
                          is no way to fill the gaping
                          hole you feel inside.
    
         Sally cowers as she hears the Mayor call:
    
                                     MAYOR (O.S.)
                          DR. FINKELSTEIN TO THE FRONT OF
                          THE LINE!  DR. FINKELSTEIN,
                          STEP RIGHT INSIDE!
    
         Sally ducks out of sight behind the FURRY BEHEMOTH in back of her
         as the
    
         EVIL SCIENTIST
    
         hobbles by.  Looking for Sally, he peers through his pince-nez at
         the faces he passes.
    
                                     MAYOR (O.S.)
                               (shouts again)
                          DR. FINKELSTEIN!  WE'RE LOOKING
                          FOR DR. FINKELSTEIN!
    
         The Evil Scientist hobbles through the front door.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. TOWN HALL. DAY/CONTINUOUS TIME.
    
         At the end of the hall is Jack.
    
         To one side of him is his Christmas treasure trunk filled to the
         brim with dolls and toys and decorations.
    
         On the other side, the Mayor sits at a table.  Before him is an
         open scroll -- a long list.  With his raven feather pen, the
         Mayor enthusiastically marks off items and occasionally scribbles
         notes: forging ahead with the making of Christmas, he and Jack
         are giving out assignments to the citizens of Halloweenland.
    
         At the moment, Jack discusses dollmaking with a COUPLE OF LARGE
         VAMPIRES...  One of the vampires cradles an example of a BABYDOLL
         in the palm of his hand.  As he rocks it, its eyes close if it's
         lying down, but open when it's brought upright.  The doll also
         cries -- bleating sadly.
    
         The Vampires make a face at one another.
    
                                     ONE VAMPIRE
                          What kind of noise is that for
                          a baby to make?
    
         The other vampire shrugs.
    
                                     JACK
                          Can you handle it?
    
                                     OTHER VAMPIRE
                          We can improve it too.
    
                                     JACK
                          I knew it!
    
         The Vampires scurry off, still studying the babydoll -- looking
         for other improvements.
    
         Jack turns to the Evil Scientist.
    
                                     JACK
                          Doctor -- just the man I wanted
                          to see.
    
         Jack pulls a book out of his trunk.  He leafs through it to a
         PICTURE OF SANTA'S REINDEER hooked up to the sleigh and shows the
         Evil Scientist.
    
                                     JACK
                          I need some of these.
    
         The Evil Scientist peers closely at the picture of the reindeer
         in Jack's book, making quick calculations.
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                          These...?  Their construction
                          should be very simple, I think.
    
         THE MAYOR
    
         bellows again, practically in the Evil Scientist's ear.
    
                                     MAYOR
                          DR. FINKELSTEIN!
    
                                     EVIL SCIENTIST
                               (snaps)
                          Right here.
    
         The Mayor glares at him resentfully.
    
                                     MAYOR
                          It's about time.
    
         The Mayor makes a big show of checking off the doctor's name.
    
         Next, three mischievous Trick Or Treaters scuttle up to the
         Mayor's table.  They are small but insidious.  Professionals.
         Their names are LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL.
    
                                     LOCK
                          We're here!  You sent for us!
    
                                     SHOCK
                          Specifically.
    
                                     BARREL
                          By name.
    
                                     LOCK
                          Lock.
    
                                     SHOCK
                          Shock.
    
                                     BARREL
                          Barrel.
    
         The Mayor announces the little Trick Or Treaters:
    
                                     MAYOR
                          Oogie Boogie's Boys to see you,
                          Jack!
    
                                     JACK
                          Excellent.
    
         The Evil Scientist shuffles off with the book.
    
         The Mayor studies his list again:

         Jack waves Lock, Shock & Barrel over...
    
                                     JACK
                          I have a very important, very
                          delicate job for you.
    
         They come close and huddle before him.  Jack whispers his plan --
         they titter, half-whispering themselves.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:

         The three little Trick Or Treaters tip-toe out, still tittering
         and whispering.  They sing:

                          We may lose some pieces and then
                          Jack will beat us black and green._

         There is a bone-chilling stirring in the next room.  All three of
         the little Trick or Treaters react.  As one, they shoot over to
         the corner furthest away from the sounds and lower their voices:

                          Perhaps he'll make his special brew

    _                      And then we'll have him, one, two, three!_
    
         Fully exuberant again, they gleefully collect their last few

         They head back up their cellar steps.

         EXT. EDGE OF FOREST. DAY/LATER.
    
         Lock, Shock & Barrel head for the forest that Jack wandered
         through.

                          And then throwaway the key._
    
         They reach the very edge forest -- they are still in the light;
         one step ahead, it is dark and gloomy.
    
         Lock, the natural-born leader of the three, stops in his tracks
         in the last possible light.  The other two bump into him, in
         succession.  Then all three crouch down at once.  Beat.
    
         Simultaneously giggling, they suddenly streak forward into the
         woods and, in a moment, are swallowed up into the
    
         PITCH-BLACK.
    
         The only evidence of them left is the sound of their giggles.
         The giggles recede, then fade...
    
                                                                   CUT TO:

         No part of the line stands outside now.  The few citizens left
         still waiting for assignments stand...
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. TOWN HALL. DUSK/CONTINUOUS TIME.
    
         A very anxious Sally stands at the head of the line, in a panic,
         going over and over what she intends to say:
    
                                     SALLY
                               (almost inaudibly)
                          Jack, you must let go of this
                          insanity...  This is a
                          mistake...
    
         Behind her the Furry Behemoth waits patiently.
    
         JACK
    
         works with the Street Band.  Demonstrating, he shakes a harness
         piece studded with sleigh bells.  The bells jingle cheerfully.
    
                                     JACK
                          Okay.  Now you.
    
         The members of the Band rattle their bones in response -- shaking
         legs and arms, echoing the jingle of the bells, but with their
         own distinctive hollow CLANK.
    
         Jack laughs, enormously pleased.
    
                                     JACK
                          Perfect!...  Now let's try
                          this...
    
         Using various jingling bells, Jack shakes out the tune to "Jingle
         Bells."
    
         The Band clanks the tune right back -- phrase for phrase.
    
         SALLY
    
         watches with an increasing sense of doom as her turn with Jack
         nears.
    
         Jack heartily shakes hands and back-slaps the three members of
         the street band.  They head off practicing...
    
                                     JACK
                               (calls after)
                          Thanks!  You're the absolute
                          best!
    
         He turns to Sally -- who stands frozen, wide-eyed, her heart a
         wild bird trapped in the cage of her chest.  He smiles
         encouragingly at her.
    
                                     JACK
                          Hi.  I've saved a really
                          special job for you.
    
         He gestures for her to step closer.
    
         Stiffly, she does.
    
                                     JACK
                               (confidentially)
                          I want you to be the one who
                          makes my Sandy Claws outfit.
    
         She looks stunned.  Jack nods eagerly and pats her, mistaking her
         silence for awe at the responsibility.
    
                                     JACK
                          I know you can do it.
    
         He enthusiastically proceeds to describe the costume:
    
                                     JACK
                          It's bright red, the reddest
                          red you can imagine -- both the
                          jacket and the pair of pants...
                          The boots are black.  There's a
                          big black belt that goes around
                          the middle...  Oh, and there's
                          white trim on the cuffs and
                          collar.
    
         Swallowing hard, Sally looks up at him, her wide eyes moist.  Her
         voice is tiny.
    
                                     SALLY
                          Are you sure, Jack?
    
         Jack suddenly looks confused.  He stops mid-gesture --
    
                                     JACK
                          Am I sure?
    
         Brow furrowing, he stares at the ceiling and thinks.
    
         Sally holds her breath, hoping...
    
         Finally, Jack shrugs.
    
                                     JACK
                          Well... the trim is
                          traditionally white from
                          everything I've studied, but if
                          you think green would give it
                          more dash...  I trust your
                          judgement.  I know you'll do a
                          great job.  Whatever you
                          decide!
    
         AT THAT MOMENT,
    
         Lock, Shock and Barrel race in dragging behind them a big sack
         with something squirming inside!
    
                                     LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL
                          Jack!  Jack!  We caught him!
                          We've got him!
    
         JACK
    
         strides excitedly to meet them, leaving Sally.
    
         SALLY
    
         flees, mortified, miserable.  She had hoped to help Jack, to
         spare him the pain of his enterprise, to save him from himself...
         Floppy and weak (her legs lost some stuffing in her jump from the
         Evil Scientist's window), she runs as best she can, arms and legs
         pinwheeling...
    
         LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL,
    
         in a frenzy of giggling, open the big sack and who should jump
         out but the
    
         EASTER BUNNY.
    
         Jack's face drops.  He turns on the three Trick Or Treaters.
    
                                     JACK
                               (loud)
                          That's not Sandy Claws!
    
                                     SHOCK
                          It isn't?
    
                                     BARREL
                          Who is it then?
    
                                     JACK
                               (louder)
                          Not Sandy Claws!
    
         The three shrink back.
    
                                     LOCK
                          We followed your instructions.
    
                                     BARREL
                          We went through the door...
    
                                     SHOCK
                          ...In the tree.
    
                                     JACK
                          Which door!?
    
                                     LOCK
                          _The_ door.
    
                                     JACK
                          WELL, TAKE HIM BACK!
    
         Jack turns to the Easter Bunny and speaks loudly and slowly to
         him, hoping to be understood.
    
                                     JACK
                          I'm very sorry for the
                          inconvenience, sir.
    
         He scowls at the three Trick Or Treaters.
    
                                     JACK
                          Shall I send somebody else for
                          Sandy Claws?
    
                                     LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL
                          No!
    
                                     BARREL
                          Not at all!
    
                                     SHOCK
                          We can handle it.
    
                                     LOCK
                          We'll get it right this time --
    
                                     LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL
                          -- for sure!
    
                                     JACK
                          I told you -- there's more than
                          one door!  Sandy Claws is
                          behind the door shaped like
                          this --
    
         He holds up a cut-out of a Christmas tree.
    
                                     LOCK
                          Got it!
    
         They stuff the Easter Bunny back into the sack and hurry off.
    
                                     JACK
                               (shouts after them)
                          Take _him_ home first.  And
                          apologize again.  Be careful
                          with Sandy Claws when you catch
                          him!  Treat him nicely!
    
         They scurry out the double doors.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. CHRISTMAS FACTORY. ANOTHER DAY.
    
         Sally sits at a sewing machine, abjectly stitching Jack's Santa
         Claus suit.  Finished with a long seam, she holds up the suit to
         see how it's coming along... and shudders in its cheerful, bright
         red glare.
    
                                     SALLY
                          If only he would come back to
                          his senses...
    
         Shaking her head, she sets the suit back in place to stitch up
         another seam.
    
         But Sally is alone in her distress.  Beyond her -- the little
         Halloween factory gladly hums along making Christmas.
    
         >>>>> _MAKING CHRISTMAS SONG --_
    
         Jack supervises and approves as the residents of Halloweenland
         busily manufacture the Halloween version of Christmas toys,
         dolls, decorations, doing their well-intentioned best to create
         the warmest, most magical Christmas yet.  The results of their
         eager efforts, unbeknownst to them, often painfully miss the
         mark:
    
         -- Barbie's a voodoo doll.
    
         -- The horrible-looking demon that springs from a Jack-In-The-Box
         has a sweet decorative bow on it.
    
         -- Strings of electric lights are composed of tiny skulls through
         which the colored lights gleam.
    
         MEANTIME,
    
         the Evil Scientist assembles Skeleton Reindeer from piles of
         bones.
    
         He also takes the opportunity to assemble himself a new and
         improved Sally.  He animates her and she smiles at him.  He is
         pleased.  She assists him in his work animating the reindeer.
    
         WHILE CHRISTMAS IS BEING MANUFACTURED IN HALLOWEENLAND, IT IS
         ALSO BEING MANUFACTURED IN...
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. CHRISTMASTOWN FACTORY. DAY/SAME TIME.
    
         The factory looks like it was constructed by a master gingerbread
         house maker, all dandy jigsaw angles and bulbous shapes and
         filigree.  There's a calendar that tells the NUMBER OF DAYS LEFT
         'TIL CHRISTMAS -- it says ONE.
    
         At quaint conveyor belts, SANTA'S ELVES work their hardest:
    
         -- Assembling the Christmas toys we most sentimentally associate
         with Christmas, among them -- cherubic baby dolls in bonnets and
         gowns, gorgeously painted wooden rocking horses.
    
         -- Wrapping the beautiful gifts, colorful papers, elaborate bows.
    
         -- Labelling packages.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. REINDEER SCHOOL. DAY.
    
         Santa's team of sleigh-pulling reindeer practices roof jumping
         techniques.  One YOUNG BUCK lands with a _splat_ and must try
         again.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. SANTA'S COTTAGE. DAY.
    
         MRS. CLAUS putters in the kitchen while
    
         SANTA CLAUS
    
         sits in his big armchair in front of a roaring fire.  He is
         checking a long list, checking it twice... when the
    
         DOORBELL
    
         rings.
    
         Setting aside his list, Santa hoists himself to his feet and
         slowly crosses to the door.  He opens it and SEES
    
         LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL
    
         crouched on his front stoop.  They cry their little banshee cry
         and leap up at his face with their sack wide open, bagging him --
         all goes
    
         BLACK.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. HALLOWEENLAND TOWN SQUARE. CHRISTMAS EVE.
    
         The town has been festooned with "Christmas" decorations.
    
         Presents are being loaded into the coffin sleigh.  The Evil
         Scientist oversees the harnessing up of his skeleton reindeer.
         He glowers over at
    
         SALLY
    
         morosely helps Jack on with the red coat of his Santa Claus
         outfit.  He already wears the pants and boots.  Jack is
         positively thrilled with the costume.
    
                                     JACK
                          It's perfect!  It couldn't be
                          more perfect!
    
         Jack laughs -- his version of a booming laugh.
    
         Sally pulls out her needle to make a last minute adjustment to
         one of the cuffs.  Then she sticks the needle back behind her ear
         where it will be handy.
    
         Jack puts on his white beard and turns eagerly to check his
    
         REFLECTION
    
         in the polished black side of the coffin sleigh.  He grins at
         himself... then, in a moment, his smile fades and he furrows his
         brow...  He peers closely at himself.
    
                                     JACK
                          Something's missing... but
                          what?  I've got the beard, the
                          coat, the boots, the belt--
    
         His musing is INTERRUPTED by the COMMOTION
    
         Lock, Shock & Barrel cause as they scuttle into view, out of
         breath, struggling with their enormous sack.
    
                                     LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL
                          This time we bagged him!
    
                                     LOCK
                          This time we really did!
    
                                     BARREL
                          He sure is big, Jack...
    
                                     SHOCK
                          And heavy...
    
         Reaching Jack, they dump the sack and reveal the prize inside,
         untying the knot and peeling back the sides, uncovering the
         legendary Sandy Claws.
    
                                     JACK
                          Sandy Claws!  Himself!  In
                          person!  I can hardly believe
                          it!  What a pleasure it is to
                          meet you!
    
         Santa blinks.  Jack grabs his hand and shakes it.
    
                                     JACK
                          Why, you have hands...  You
                          don't have claws at all...
    
         Santa looks around to see where he has been brought.  He gapes in
         horror at the "Christmas" decorations everywhere, at the coffin
         sleigh, at the reindeer, at the staring residents of
         Halloweenland, at Jack before him in what looks very much like a
         deflated version of his own outfit.  THE SHOCK RENDERS HIM
         SPEECHLESS.
    
                                     JACK
                               (delighted by Santa's
                                reaction)
                          Surprised, aren't you?  I knew
                          you would be!  But you haven't
                          seen anything yet...
    
         Jack pauses a beat for impact, then springs the good news:
    
                                     JACK (CONT'D)
                          You don't need to have another
                          worry about Christmas this
                          year.  Not a single care.
                          We've seen to every detail.
    
         Santa's eyes go wide and he begins to sputter -- searching for
         the words that could conceivably express the depths of his
         feelings.
    
         Sally looks on, horrified.
    
                                     JACK (CONT'D)
                          Consider this a vacation,
                          Sandy, a reward.  You've worked
                          hard for a long time.  It's
                          your turn to take it easy.
                          Leave everything to me...
                          You're going to be so pleased.
                          You just relax and enjoy
                          yourself while you're here.
                               (to Lock, Shock &
                                Barrel)
                          See that he's comfortable,
                          boys...
    
         Lock, Shock and Barrel grab ahold of Santa to drag him off again,
         but Jack stops them--
    
                                     JACK (CONT'D)
                          Just a second, fellas.
    
         Jack plucks the red cap off Santa's head.
    
                                     JACK (CONT'D)
                          Of course!  _That's_ what I'm
                          missing....  You don't mind if
                          I borrow it, do you?  Thanks!
    
         He pops Santa's cap on his own head.  It is too big and droops
         charmingly over one of Jack's big eye sockets.  He grins the
         biggest grin yet.

                               (chants softly to
                                herself)
                          There must be something...
                          There must be something...
                          There must be something I can
                          do to stop him...  I know!
                          I'll make him some tea!
    
         She rushes off.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:

         Lock, Shock & Barrel strain to push/pull/haul/carry the
         astonished, still sputtering Santa Claus through town.

                          place in the whole _world_ more
                          comfortable than that, is
                          there?
    
                                     SHOCK & BARREL
                          No, there isn't!

                          And Jack said to make him
                          comfortable, didn't he?
    
                                     SHOCK & BARREL
                          Yes, he did!
    
         The three gleefully giggle their hideous giggle.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. TOWN SQUARE. CHRISTMAS EVE/LATER.
    
         The Mayor gives Jack the grandest possible Halloween send-off:
    
                                     MAYOR
                          ...Think of us as you soar
                          triumphantly through the sky,
                          outshining any star, your
                          silhouette a dark blot breaking
                          the perfect circle of the
                          moon...  We who are left behind
                          here will surely be thinking of
                          you.
    
         Jack stands tall beside his sleigh.
    
         THE STREET BAND
    
         rattles a delicate "Jingle Bells."
    
         THE TOWNSPEOPLE
    
         look on proudly.
    
         SALLY
    
         hurries back with a steaming cup of her special sleeping-potion
         tea.
    
         THE MAYOR
    
         blabs on:
    
                                     MAYOR (CONT'D)
                          You who are our pride; you who
                          are our glory; you who have
                          frightened millions into an
                          early grave; you who have
                          devastated --
    
         His speech is SUDDENLY INTERRUPTED BY THE
    
         DESCENT OF A THICK HALLOWEEN FOG.
    
         The fog swirls around the assembled crowd.  It licks at the
         Mayor.  It threatens to engulf Jack, the sleigh, the skeleton
         reindeer.
    
                                     JACK
                          Oh no...!
    
         SALLY
    
         gazes about her in happy wonder.  The sight of the fog brings a
         wide, welcoming look of hope to her face.
    
         She dumps out the tea -- it eats a hole in the ground -- she
         won't be needing it after all...
    
         THE FOG
    
         swallows everyone.
    
                                     JACK (O.S.)
                          I'll never get the sleigh off
                          the ground in this.  The
                          reindeer can't see an inch in
                          front of their noses...
    
                                     VAMPIRE VOICE (O.S.)
                          This fog's as thick as...
    
                                     MONSTER VOICE (O.S.)
                               (finishes the thought)
                          ...Jellied brains.
    
                                     VAMPIRE VOICE (O.S.)
                          Yeah...
    
                                     JACK (O.S.)
                               (woe increasing)
                          There go my hopes, my plans, my
                          dreams... the tall-tales, the
                          legends, the lies...
    
         There is a thin ghostly bark (O.S.) -- it belongs to Zero.  His
         little jack o'lantern nose floats in... a tiny beacon penetrating
         the fog.
    
                                     CORPSE VOICE (O.S.)
                               (dour and slow)
                          There goes Christmas...
    
                                     JACK (O.S.)
                               (morose)
                          No, Zero...  Not now...  Down,
                          boy...
    
         After a long beat...
    
                                     JACK (O.S.)
                               (has a sudden idea)
                          Hey!  WAIT A MINUTE!
    
         We HEAR the sounds of RUMMAGING, of Jack MUTTERING:
    
                                     JACK (O.S.)
                          Where did I put that book...?
                          I know it's in here
                          somewhere...  Here it is...
    
         We HEAR pages turned back and forth...  Then with characteristic
         melodramatic flourish Jack RECITES:
    
                                     JACK (O.S.)
                          'Zero with your nose so bright,
                          Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?'
    
         Barking, Zero swoops with pure joy.
    
         The crowd cheers.
    
         Zero floats to the front of the sleigh and takes position.  His
         jack o'lantern nose glows brighter and brighter, soon
         illuminating the whole sleigh.  Jack leaps aboard.
    
                                     JACK
                          We're off!
    
         With a crack of his skeleton whip, Jack and his ghostly entourage
         are instantly aloft.  In a moment, they are gone...
    
         SALLY
    
         gapes into the swirling fog.  She stares miserably into the cup
         she emptied, then back up into the fog-choked sky.
    
         >>>>> _SALLY'S SONG_
    
         The Street Band materializes out of the fog.  They listen to her
         mournful song.  Moved, they accompany her.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. STARRY, STARRY NIGHT. CHRISTMAS EVE.
    
         Jack's coffin sleigh whiplashes wildly through the glittering
         night sky -- a giddy, out of control amusement park ride.  At the
         front of the sleigh, Zero exuberantly howls.
    
         FAR BELOW,
    
         peaceful little houses dot the landscape, innocently waiting for
         Christmas.
    
         Laughing his best booming Santa laugh, Jack begins his descent.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. SUBURBIA. CHRISTMAS EVE/LATER.
    
         The coffin sleigh CRASH LANDS on the roof of a little house,
         making such a racket that it wakes the sleeping family inside:
         the BABY CRIES BLOODY MURDER and we can HEAR the VOICE OF THE
         WIFE URGING HER HUSBAND TO INVESTIGATE.
    
         A big grin slashed across his face, Jack pops up out of the
         wreckage.  He gleefully slithers over to the chimney and JUMPS
         inside.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. LITTLE HOUSE. CHRISTMAS EVE/LATER.
    
         JACK'S SKELETAL HAND
    
         drops hideous little toys into the Christmas stockings hung up
         along the fireplace mantelpiece.
    
         THE HYSTERICAL VOICES (O.S.)
    
         continue: ("Get the gun!"  "We don't have a gun!"  "Well, grab
         something!").  As does the CRYING of the baby.  CLOSE BY:
    
                                     LITTLE BOY'S VOICE (O.S.)
                               (sweetly)
                          Santa?
    
         JACK
    
         spins around to see A LITTLE BOY STARING UP AT HIM.  At the sight
         of Jack, the little boy looks stunned.
    
                                     JACK
                          Merry Christmas!
    
         Jack springs over to the boy.  The little boy stands frozen in
         place.  The chaos (O.S.) persists:  ("Where is he?"  "He's not in
         his bed?"  "No!"  "Check downstairs."  "_You_ check downstairs.")
         Overhead, footsteps thump to and fro.  The baby still bawls.
         Jack bends down to the little boy.
    
                                     JACK
                          And what is your name?
    
         The boy doesn't answer, doesn't move; he just keeps staring.
    
                                     JACK
                          I bet I have a special present
                          for you anyway!
    
         Jack fishes into his big sack of toys.  He pulls a SHRUNKEN HEAD
         out by its hank of hair and hands it to the little boy.
    
                                     JACK
                          There you go, sonny!
    
         With a screeching "Ho, Ho, Ho," Jack springs back to the
         fireplace and WHOOSHES up the
    
         CHIMNEY to the...
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. ROOFTOP. CHRISTMAS EVE/CONTINUOUS TIME.
    
         Jack leaps onto the remains of his coffin sleigh and off he
         flies.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. LITTLE HOUSE. CHRISTMAS EVE/SAME TIME.
    
         Still standing where Jack left him, the little boy stares
         morosely into the grotesque face of the Shrunken Head.
    
         (O.S.) Footsteps charge down the steps and pound down the hall to
         the living room doorway -- both parents at once.  We HEAR their
         horrified reactions, their BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAMS.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. ROOFTOPS. CHRISTMAS EVE/LATER.
    
         Jack leaps nimbly from rooftop to rooftop -- merrily delivering
         presents, blissfully unaware of the havoc he is creating....
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. HALLOWEENLAND. CHRISTMAS EVE/SAME TIME.
    
         Several residents of Halloweenland eagerly crowd around the
         witches' cauldron to watch Jack whose giddy journey above the
         rooftops is reflected in the bubbling brew.  The gathering oohs
         and ahhhs and applauds.
    
         Sally is not among those watching.  A shriek of joy makes her
         peek forlornly out from behind a distant building.  She pulls
         back out of sight.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:

         -- A BABY DOLL is cradled in the lap of a LITTLE GIRL.  For no
         apparent reason, the baby doll's eyes SUDDENLY OPEN.  The little
         girl shrieks and throws the doll off her lap.
    
         -- A MAN-EATING WREATH snakes off the door where it hangs,
         sending out tentacles and tendrils that wrap around the LEGS OF A
         KISSING COUPLE, YANKING THEM CLEAR OFF THEIR FEET.
    
         -- A VAMPIRE TEDDY BEAR smiles as it totters across a room.
    
         -- THE TRACKS OF A MONSTROUS TOY TRAIN slither around a room,
         chasing RETREATING CHILDREN.

         Jack gleefully continues delivering Christmas, mistaking the
         irate screams and shaking fists of citizens below for gratitude.
         He waves and calls:
    
                                     JACK
                          YOU'RE WELCOME!!!

         THE SEVERAL PHONES lined up on the SERGEANT'S DESK ring off the

         answers phone after phone:

                                                                   CUT TO:

         Sally picks up the broadcast in the sewing needle she stuck
         behind her ear:
    
                                     RADIO BROADCAST (CONT'D)
                          -- mocking and mangling this
                          joyous holiday.  Gruesome
                          nightmares have replaced the
                          visions of sugarplums that
                          should be dancing in our
                          children's heads.  Whole
                          families scream in terror.  The
                          authorities assure us that, at
                          this moment, the military is
                          mobilizing to stop whoever it
                          is that is perpetrating this
                          heinous crime...  The monster
                          must and will be stopped.
                          Santa Claus! -- wherever you
                          are.  Come back!  Come back and
                          set things right!  The whole
                          world is in a panic!
    
         Hearing this, Sally too is in a panic.  She runs one way, then
         the other.
    
                                     SALLY
                          I've got to help Jack!
    
         She runs off.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. BOOGIE WOOGIE'S JAIL. CHRISTMAS EVE/SAME TIME.
    
         Santa is behind bars, tied to a chair, in this dank, dripping,
         dark hell-hole that is Oogie Boogie's jail.
    
                                     SANTA
                               (bellows)
                          OUT!  LET ME OUT!  I'VE GOT TO
                          GET OUT OF HERE NOW!  IT'S
                          CHRISTMAS!!!
    
         Lock, Shock & Barrel watch, giggling.
    
                                     LOCK
                          You'd better be quiet, Sandy.
    
                                     SHOCK
                          Maybe he doesn't know...
    
                                     BARREL
                          He _has_ to know...
    
                                     LOCK
                          Everybody knows about--
    
         He's interrupted by a FEARSOME GROANING (O.S.).  All three of the
         little Trick or Treaters whip around at the sound.
    
                                     LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL
                          Uh-oh.
    
         They high-tail it out of there.  Oogie Boogie is on his way...
    
         >>>>> _OOGIE BOOGIE'S SONG._
    
         Oogie Boogie is an enormous shapeless sack, bulging with creepy-
         crawlies.  He rolls and oozes rather than walks.
    
         As Oogie Boogie's song concludes... a SHAPELY FEMALE LEG (that we
         recognize as Sally's), wearing a high, high heel and exposed up
         to the garter, eases seductively into view outside the jailhouse
         doorway.
    
         When there isn't an immediate reaction, the toe taps impatiently.
    
         Oogie hears...
    
                                     OOGIE BOOGIE
                          Huh?
    
         He turns and spots the beautifully turned leg.  The leg kicks a
         can-can, once, twice...
    
                                     OOGIE BOOGIE
                          Ooo la la...
    
         He chuckles to himself and slathers.  Relishing the anticipation,
         he rolls ever so slowly toward the enticement at the doorway...
         leaving his prisoner completely behind.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. OOGIE BOOGIE'S JAIL. CHRISTMAS EVE/SAME TIME.
    
         Meantime, the REST OF SALLY hops on her remaining leg around the
         outside of Boogie's jail to the
    
         BACK.
    
         She peeks through the tiny, barred window to SEE
    
         INSIDE
    
         where Santa Claus bucks in his chair, desperate to escape.
    
                                     SALLY
                               (whispers)
                          Sandy...
    
         He whips around and is about to holler.
    
                                     SALLY
                               (cuts him off before
                                he can yell)
                          Ssh.  I'm here to help you.
    
                                     SANTA
                               (whispered with all
                                the force of
                                shouting)
                          Get me out of here!
    
         Sally reaches in through the bars, straining to touch Santa
         Claus.  He tries to move the chair toward her, but, try as he
         might, he can't.  He is ready to burst with frustration.
    
                                     SANTA
                          It's no use...
    
                                     SALLY
                          You discourage too easily.
                          Just hang on.
    
         She pulls off both her arms -- the left yanks the right out of
         the socket, popping the stitches, and the right yanks the left.
    
         Santa swallows his scream of horror as Sally's unattached arms
         crawl through the bars and into the cell with him.
    
         ONE ARM
    
         scuttles to his ropes and begins picking at the knots while the
    
         OTHER ARM
    
         scoots out of the cell, behind Oogie Boogie -- who still oozes
         toward the leg at the door.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:

         The BIG GUNS fire into the night sky.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. STARRY, STARRY NIGHT. CHRISTMAS EVE/SAME TIME.
    
         Far below, the guns fire.  Jack mistakes the artillery for
         fireworks.
    
                                     JACK
                          Doesn't that look fun, Zero?!
                          They're celebrating!  They're
                          thanking us for doing such a
                          good job!
    
         Zero yaps happily and, nose in the air, swings gleefully back and
         forth in the harness at the head of the sleigh -- narrowly
         missing being blasted to smithereens by a well-guided MISSILE.
         It was only the exuberant swinging that saved him.  His eyes
         goggle.  He bristles mid-air and begins to flail.
    
                                     JACK
                               (calls down)
                          Whoa!  Careful down there, you
                          guys!  That was a pretty close
                          shave!
                               (reassures Zero)
                          It's okay, boy...  Head higher.
    
         Zero regains control and flies up.
    
         The explosions below blast on.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         INT. OOGIE BOOGIE'S JAIL. CHRISTMAS EVE/SAME TIME.
    
         Santa's own hands are now free, attacking the rest of the knots
         that bind him while Sally's stray hand picks the lock on the cell
         door.  In a moment, he is free.  In another moment, the door
         swings open.
    
         Grabbing Sally's arm, Santa lumbers out the door toward freedom.
         Only Oogie Boogie himself stands in the way.
    
         OOGIE BOOGIE
    
         has just reached the door.  Sally's crawling hand has almost
         reached him.
    
         Making lascivious noises, Oogie Boogie peeks out to see what the
         body that belongs to such a gorgeous leg might possibly look like
         and is surprised to find nothing there... no body at all...
    
                                     OOGIE BOOGIE
                          Huh?
    
         It dawns on him that he's been had.  Roaring, he wheels around --
         only to see that Santa is loose and coming toward him.  He roars
         louder and starts forward to set things right when...
    
         SALLY'S HAND,
    
         the one that had been tailing him, leaps up and pulls the end of
         a thread on the sack that is Oogie Boogie's shapeless body.  The
         thread pulls out, LEAVING A GAPING OPENING IN OOGIE BOOGIE...
    
         Oogie Boogie wails as
    
         HIS GRUESOME CONTENTS IMMEDIATELY FLY, CRAWL, SLITHER, WRITHE,
         JUMP OUT.  THE BAG ITSELF COLLAPSES TO THE GROUND, EMPTY.
         SILENT.
    
         THE REST OF SALLY
    
         -- torso, head, one leg -- hops into view from around the corner.
    
         SANTA
    
         grabs up Sally's arm still holding the string and is about to
         sweep up her other leg and the rest of her when there is a
    
         SUDDEN ROAR
    
         behind him -- OOGIE BOOGIE RETURNED TO LIFE.  The empty bag opens
         up and with the SUCTION from hell SUCKS SANTA AND SALLY inside.
    
         BLACK.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:

         Jack and his ghostly team now frantically but successfully dodge
         a barrage of missiles... only in the next instant to suffer a
         DIRECT HIT and
    
         EXPLODE!
    
         The explosion is huge, fiery.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:

         The explosion is being simulcast to the group of Halloween
         townspeople in the witches' cauldron.
    
         They gape at the fireball in confusion and disbelief.
    
         The Mayor turns away... ever the politician... his two faces
         compete to be the first to speak -- one of them wins.
    
                                     MAYOR
                          I knew this Christmas thing was
                          a bad idea...  I had a feeling
                          in my bones...
    
         The Mayor climbs aboard his hearse and is driven off.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:

         Clutching a burning bag of toys, Jack falls.  He holds onto
         Zero -- who turns into a whimpering parachute.
    
         Jack, voice choked, cries out in anguished sincerity:
    
                                     JACK
                          Merry Christmas to all and to
                          all a good night!
    
         Jack lets go of Zero and plummets toward earth.
    
         EXT. CEMETERY. CHRISTMAS EVE/CONTINUOUS TIME.
    
         Jack lands hard, bones clattering.  Zero floats down beside him.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:

         Santa and Sally (more or less stuck together again) are cornered
         by Oogie Boogie -- he is in the process of snatching the escaped
         parts of himself out of the air and stuffing them back in.
    
                                     OOGIE BOOGIE
                          Now what am I going to do with
                          you two?
    
                                     SALLY
                          You try anything and you just
                          wait 'til Jack gets back.
    
         THE MAYOR'S HEARSE passes (O.S.) -- blaring the announcement.
    
                                     MAYOR'S AMPLIFIED VOICE (O.S.)
                          Jack has been blown to
                          smithereens.  Christmas is
                          over.  Skeleton Jack is no
                          more...
    
         Oogie Boogie chuckles.  He leers at Sally.
    
                                     OOGIE BOOGIE
                          You were saying?
    
         He grabs a squiggly something and shoves it back into his sack.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:

         For a long time, Jack doesn't move.  He lies flat, sprawled face
         down across a couple of tombstones.  Finally, he hauls himself up
         on a large stone cross.
    
                                     JACK
                               (voice weak)
                          I thought I could be Santa.  I
                          thought I could be better than
                          Santa.  And what did I do
                          instead?  Instead I killed
                          Christmas.
    
         Crumpling, Jack weeps.  Zero, ever faithful, makes himself a
         hankie and wipes Jack's wet eyes.
    
         >>>>> _JACK'S SADDEST OF SAD SONGS._
    
         Jack sings as if his heart had broken in two.  He is at his
         lowest of lows.  Yet, being Jack, being irrepressibly buoyant, by
         the end of the song, he has completely worked himself back up
         from grief very nearly to exuberance -- he must save Santa!  He
         must restore Christmas as it should be!
    
         He opens a tombstone, lifting it up as easily as if it were the
         door to a storm cellar and, filled with determination, runs back
         down toward Halloweenland.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:

         Santa and Sally dangle perilously above a PIT.  They've been
         bound and gagged and they writhe in terror.
    
         From the murky depths below, SKELETON CROCODILES leap up at them,
         jaws snapping hungrily.  Watching, Oogie Boogie snickers.  He
         lowers Santa and Sally closer.

                          I'd say it's about time we put
                          some meat on their bones, don't
                          you?
    
         Suddenly, there's a
    
         CRASH
    
         behind him -- the crash of the door being kicked in.
    
         And there stands
    
         JACK.
    
                                     JACK
                          I should say so.
    
         Jack sweeps Boogie off his feet and holds him above the pit
         himself.  Immediately, the terrorizer is terrified.
    
                                     OOGIE BOOGIE
                          Jack!  How great to see you.
                          We were all worried about you.
                          I was just giving our guests
                          here a... a tour of the place.
                          I told them it was dangerous,
                          but they insisted on a closer
                          look.  What could I do?
    
         He smiles sheepishly.
    
                                     JACK
                          How about the whole show?
    
         He dumps Oogie Boogie over the edge, but delicately keeps ahold
         of a choice thread.
    
         AS HE FALLS, OOGIE BOOGIE UNRAVELS COMPLETELY.
    
         His insides escape into the dark -- with the sounds of wings
         flapping and feet skittering -- and, IN THE END, ALL THAT'S LEFT
         OF HIS SHAPELESS SACK OF A BODY IS ONE LONG THREAD.
    
         In the pit below, the crocodile skeletons scoot around, jaws
         clapping, having themselves a feast.
    
         LATER,
    
         Jack finishes untying Santa and Sally.  He works quickly.  He
         ungags Sally.
    
                                     SALLY
                               (with glad relief)
                          We heard you'd been pulverized
                          to _bone dust_.
    
                                     JACK
                          For what I did, I deserve to be
                          bone dust.
    
         Jack looks away from Santa's angry gaze.  He takes off Santa's
         cap and replaces it on Santa's head...
    
                                     JACK
                          This is where it belongs...  I
                          was only trying to do a good
                          job, but I made a real mess of
                          everything.  I'm sorry.
    
         Cringing, he unties Santa's gag.  Santa scowls and straightens
         his cap but, rather than chastise Jack, immediately makes for the
         door.
    
                                     SANTA
                          No time to talk now...  I've
                          got to go fix Christmas!
    
         Santa charges off.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. HALLOWEENLAND STREET. CHRISTMAS EVE/LATER.
    
         Various townspeople duck out of the way to avoid Jack -- who has
         stopped to gaze up into the empty night sky.  Zero floats beside
         him.
    
                                     JACK
                          I hope it's not too late for
                          him to set Christmas right.
    
         Jack sighs and drags himself up the deserted street.
    
                                     JACK
                          Well, Zero... I guess it's just
                          you and me...
                               (the thought dawns)
                          ...And Sally.  She sure stuck
                          by us, didn't she?
    
         Downcast as he stalks along, Jack doesn't notice when it begins
         to
    
         SNOW.
    
         At first, just a few sparkling flakes fall.
    
                                     VAMPIRE VOICE (O.S.)
                          Look!
    
                                     BIG MONSTER VOICE (O.S.)
                          What is it?
    
         It snows more and more.
    
                                     WITCH VOICE (O.S.)
                          White thing's...
    
                                     ANOTHER WITCH VOICE (O.S.)
                          Everywhere...
    
                                     HIGH GHOUL VOICE (O.S.)
                          Could it be --
    
                                     DEEP GHOUL VOICE (O.S.)
                               (finishes the
                                thought)
                          -- SNOW??
    
         Zero barks excitedly.  Jack finally looks up.
    
                                     JACK
                               (with wonder)
                          It _is_ snow...  But how?
    
         As if in answer to Jack's question we HEAR
    
         SANTA'S BOOMING HO-HO-HO
    
         high up in the sky.
    
         A SLOW SMILE SPREADS ACROSS JACK'S FACE.
    
         The residents of Halloween come out to experience the snow --
         this miracle of Christmas that has come to Halloween.
    
         >>>>> _CELEBRATION SONG (ECHO OF 'WHAT'S THIS?'?)_
    
         Jack joins in the celebration -- but seems always to be looking
         around for someone.
    
                                                                   CUT TO:
    
         EXT. CEMETERY. CHRISTMAS EVE/CONTINUOUS TIME.
    
         As the celebrating goes on in town below, Sally climbs Cemetery
         Hill.  Sitting down at the top, she looks out at the round moon
         which shines behind the curtain of falling snow.  She is moved to
         sing a brief reprise of
    
         >>>>> _SALLY'S SONG_
    
         Soon, A SECOND VOICE joins in, making the song a DUET.  The
         second voice belongs to
    
         JACK.
    
         He has found Sally.
    
         Jack sings:
    
                                     JACK
    _                    My dearest friend, if you don't mind
                         I'd like to join you by your side
                        Let's sit together, you and I
                         Alone, where we can watch the sky._
    
         He sits beside her.  Together they look out at the moon and the
         snow.
    
         WE PULL BACK AND UP:
    
         Above the CLOUDS and the SNOW, past SANTA flying into the
         distance aboard his sleigh, above the gleaming light of the
         Christmas MOON, and into the NIGHT, pulling BACK AND BACK INTO
         THE STARS...
    
         Santa's voice returns to narrate:
    
                                     SANTA (V.O.)
                 And finally, everything worked out just fine --
                   Christmas was saved, though there wasn't much time.
    
                 But, after that night, things were never the same,
                   Each holiday now knew the other one's name.
    
                 And so when their long isolation had ended,
                   They cautiously reached out, and slowly befriended.
    
                 And each shared a bit of the things that they had
                   With each other, and found out it wasn't so bad --
    
                 They had snowflakes in Halloween, those we could spare,
                   And we here in Christmas enjoyed a few scares.
    
                 The fireworks gave the Easter Bunnies a thrill
                   And St. Patrick's Day cherishes Easter Eggs still.
    
                 And though that one Christmas, things got out of hand,
                   I'm still rather fond of that skeleton man.
    
                 Though misguided I think his intentions were good.
                   He was just a poor skeleton misunderstood.
    
                 So many years later I thought I'd drop in,
                   And there was old Jack, still looking quite thin.
    
                 With four or five skeleton children at hand
                   Playing strange little tunes in their xylophone band.
    
                 And I asked old Jack, 'Do you remember the night,
                   When the sky was so dark, and the moon shone so bright?
    
                 'When a million small children pretending to sleep
                   Nearly didn't have Christmas at all, so to speak?
    
                 'And would, if you could, turn that mighty clock back
                   To that long fateful night?  Now, think carefully, Jack.
    
                 'Would you do the whole thing all over again?
                   Knowing what you know now, knowing what you knew then?'
    
                 And he smiled like the old Pumpkin King that I knew,
                   Then turned, and asked softly of me... 'Wouldn't you?'
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
                                     THE END
