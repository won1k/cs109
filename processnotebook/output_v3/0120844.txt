                   1   TALL GRASS BLOWING GENTLY IN A BREEZE - DAY - (OPTICAL)        1
    
                       The sound of children playing, running through the
                       grass... as one boy (ARTIM, 12) pokes his head out, we
                       see by his facial skin pattern that he's an alien... his
                       cloths are simple, homespun. As other alien children
                       pursue him in a game of tag into the rocky foothills, we
                       BOOM UP to reveal a breathtaking view of a rural
                       community along a vast sparkling lake... mountains rising
                       in the background...some odd-like livestock graze
                       on the hillside...
    
                   2   A FARM - LONG SHOT                                             2
    
                       A woman uses a bike pump to get well water...a man works
                       the soil in his fields, wipes his brow, waving to --
    
                   3   A WOMAN (ANIJ, 38)                                             3
    
                       whose beauty immediately captivates us as she strolls
                       past the farm, the wind barely jostling her close cut
                       curly hair. She takes us to a busy outdoor farmers
                       market at the edge of a hand-constructed village set
                       against a natural rock face barrier. These are the Ba'ku
                       people and from the opening shots we can feel the simple
                       charms of this beautiful place... and who would blame us
                       for wanting to be there, to escape a life like this...
                       where people seem to have all the time in the world... to
                       chat with neighbors, taste a piece of fresh fruit and
                       enjoy the day... Anij nods hello to people including
                       SOJEF (male, 42), the community leader... she smiles as a
                       vendor slices a piece of fruit for her...

                       From the point of view of the rock face behind the
                       village. Although we may not realize it yet, we are
                       watching through a window now... slightly discolored,
                       pulling back to see a mysterious figure in an isolation
                       suit standing incongruously beside her, his suit glowing
                       with a green force field. None of the Ba'ku are aware of
                       him as he takes readings with a sophisticated sensor
                       device built into his suit. Now our pullback reveals
                       we're inside a duck blind. Low lighting levels. A bi-
                       level gallery of Starfleet officers and members of an
                       alien race (the Son'a) observe the peaceful village scene
                       like sportswriters at the ballpark...

                       Inside the duck blind. Like all Son'a, his face is
                       stretched like a rubber band about to snap...they look
                       like victims of three too many cosmetic surgeries. He

                       removes his helmet... the boy yells... jumps back,
                       falling as Data makes eye contact with him. The Ba'ku

                       crunch and a green force field sputters briefly -- a Son'a
                       man in a torn isolation suit partially DECLOAKS as he is
                       slammed to the ground, unconscious. Data rips off the
                       rest of his suit revealing himself, picks up a weapon
                       from the unconscious Son'a, aims it at the rock face...

                  30   A MONITOR -- INT. ANTEROOM OFF BANQUET ROOM - (OPTICAL)       30
    
                       Admiral MATTHEW DOUGHERTY, 69, a confident, charismatic
                       officer is transmitting from a Son'a ship.
    
                                               DOUGHERTY
                                 He's not acknowledging any
                                 Starfleet protocols... not
                                 responding to any of our hails...
    
                       We pull back to see we're in a small room off the
                       reception... Picard faces the monitor (he's removed the
                       headpiece). Geordi observes. A Starfleet Ensign stands
                       guard just outside the door to make sure they're not
                       disturbed.
    
                                               PICARD
                                 You have no idea what
                                 precipitated his behavior?
    
                                               DOUGHERTY
                                         (shakes his head)
                                 ... And now he's holding our
                                 people hostage down there...
    
                                               PICARD
                                 The Enterprise can be at your
                                 position in two days, Admiral...
    
                                               DOUGHERTY
                                 That's probably not a good idea.
                                 Your ship hasn't been fitted for
                                 this region; there are
                                 environmental concerns...
    
                                               PICARD
                                 What kind of concerns?
    
                                               DOUGHERTY
                                 We haven't fully identified the
                                 anomalies yet. They're calling
                                 this whole area The Briar
                                 Patch... it took us a day to reach
                                 a location where we could get a
                                 signal out to you. Just get me
                                 Data's schematics. I'll keep you
                                 informed.

                                 Dougherty out.
    
                       The screen returns to a starfield.
    
                                               PICARD
                                 Send him the schematics.
    
                       Geordi acknowledges.

                                 chef to skip the fish course.
    
                       The Ensign gives a puzzled reaction but an order is an
                       order. He exits. Geordi gives his Captain a curious
                       look.

                                 I want our guests to depart as
                                 quickly a etiquette allows.
                                 I'll ask Worf to delay his return
                                 to DS9 so he can join us. We're
                                 going to stop by sector four-four-
                                 one on our way to the Goren

                       La Forge smiles, leaves. Picard takes a beat to collect
                       himself and we may sense how the clutter in a Captain's
                       life may wear him down. He puts the alien headpiece back
                       on with sullen eyes...  then restores his diplomat's face
                       and returns to the reception...

                       moving toward a ringed planet well in the distance,
                       passing slowly through wisps of space matter...
                       wonderful, glowing plasma tendrils like legs of a

                       Low lighting. Strange futuristic dialysis machines pump
                       fluids in and out of reclined Son'a men and women... the
                       women use powder and heavy but carefully applied make-up
                       to obscure their faces. Son'a costumes are made of
                       expensive fabrics with latinum chains and exquisite
                       jewels as accessories, suggesting a wealthy culture that
                       values materialism. Sexy female attendants from various
                       alien races, dressed provocatively, work with laser tools
                       to repair cracked, raw skin off Son'a faces. We move to
                       find RU'AFO, 63, the Son'a Ahdar (Commander), reclining
                       getting an elaborate facial from two beauties, creams and
                       oils massaged into his skin by their gentle fingertips...

                       emerging from a fog bank... it is a Federation Scout ship --

                                 Tea. Earl Grey. Hot.
    
                       The tea appears as we pull back to reveal Picard studying
                       a PADD... he reaches out for the tea without his eyes
                       ever leaving his reading... walks across the room and
                       sits at a dining table that has stacks of various work
                       materials... more PADDS, charts and graphs and maps... a
                       half-eaten salad sits in front of him... and in a move
                       that would challenge the world's greatest juggler, he
                       pokes a fork of salad into his mouth with one hand as he
                       sips his tea with the other, finding a spot to prop the
                       PADD so he can still read... and now, his mind, asking a 
                       silent question, reaching over to grab a chart, and as he
                       pulls it over, he also spills the salad plate splashing
                       gorgonzolla dressing over his jacket... sighs... a chime
                       at the door...

                                 Who is it?

                       Picard looks at himself, shrugs, what the hell...

                                 Come...
    
                       Riker enters with a PADD, eyes drawn to Picard's stained
                       jacket...

                       Picard takes off his jacket... and as the scene
                       continues, he changes.
    
                                               PICARD (CONT'D)
                                 I've been going over the few star
                                 charts we have of this "Briar
                                 Patch". It's full of supernova
                                 remnants, false vacuum
                                 fluctuations...
    
                       Riker looks at the star chart, brushes it off...

                                 concerns' the Admiral was talking
                                 about?

                       reading but seems distracted... sees a paper notepad on
                       the desk, rips off a shred and, during the following
                       exchange, starts to press it between her thumb and

                       of the head... he turns but she's looking innocently at

                       He turns to see an alien ensign looking too innocently at
                       his computer. The librarian's eyes fix on Riker and
                       Troi, obvious troublemakers... Troi points to Riker...

                                 He started it.
    
                       Riker reacts, starts to leave... Troi follows...

                                 I know what Data means to
                                 Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our
                                 crew is at the mercy of those

                                 Data fails, I will terminate him.

                                 I should be the one to do it.
                                 I'm his Captain. And his friend.
    
                       Dougherty pauses to consider but Ru'afo wants none of
                       Picard.
    
                                               RU'AFO
                                 It isn't safe for you to remain
                                 in this area.

                       The Admiral studies him a long beat, is sympathetic to
                       Picard's position.

                                 All right. You have twelve

                                 out of The Briar Patch. In the

                       The hostages are sitting at wooden tables with the Ba'ku
                       having lunch, the Son'a quietly keeping to themselves at
                       separate tables. To the side, Artim and friends play a
                       game (TBD) that displays extraordinary hand-eye
                       coordination, well beyond human abilities.

                       the hum of conversation fades... for a moment, it almost

                                 village is a sanctuary of life.
    
                       Picard measures the request... then holsters his

                                 the same way after what happened.

                                 member of my crew. Apparently,
                                 he became... ill...

                                 There did seem to be a phase

                                 that we were unable to repair.
    
                       Picard reacts, not the sort of thing one expects to hear

                                 hard to believe that we'd have
                                 any skills repairing a positronic

                                 aren't apparent because we've
                                 chosen not to employ them in our
                                 daily lives. We believe when you
                                 create a machine to do the work
                                 of a man, you take something away
                                 from the man.

                                 But at one time, we explored the
                                 galaxy just as you do...

                                 Capability, yes. But where can
                                 warp drive take us, except away
                                 from here...?
    
                       Clearly establishing that she and her people have very
                       little interest in life beyond their world. Picard
                       allows himself to take in this glorious setting... a
                       humming bird hovers briefly nearby... it is the kind of
                       paradise that would appeal to any contemporary man trying
                       to escape the clutter of his life if only for a brief
                       respite... and at least, to that extent --

                       Picard turns off the monitor, glances at the pile of work
                       PADDS -- his "paperwork" -- on his desk without
                       pleasure... 
    
                       picks one up and begins to study it for a beat... then is 
                       drawn to the window, where he can see the warm inviting
                       planet below.

                       She's sitting on the sofa making some notes on a PADD
                       when the door chimes...
    
                                               TROI
                                 Come in.
                                         (Riker enters)
                                 Hi.
    
                                               RIKER
                                 Got a minute? I... need a little
                                 counseling.
                                         (off her surprise)
                                 First time for everything. Do
                                 I... lie down... or what?
    
                                               TROI
                                 Whatever makes you comfortable...
    
                       Riker lies down, only he winds up with his head on her
                       lap looking up at her...
    
                                               TROI
                                 This isn't one of the usual
                                 therapeutic postures...
    
                                               RIKER
                                 But it's comfortable.
    
                                               TROI
                                 Why don't you try sitting up?
    
                                               RIKER
                                 Or you could try lying down.
    
                                               TROI
                                 You're in quite a mood today.
    
                       He finally sits up, stealing a kiss along the way... she
                       rises shocked but not upset...
    
                                               TROI
                                 Do you really need counseling or
                                 did you come down here to play?
    
                       Riker is on his feet now, approaching her. She retreats.
    
                                               RIKER
                                 Both.
                                         (off her look)
                                 I think I'm having a mid-life
                                 crisis...
    
                                               TROI
                                         (retreating)
                                 ... I believe you...
    
                                               RIKER
                                 ... I'm not sleeping well...
    
                                               TROI
                                 ... Doctor Crusher has something
                                 that'll take care of that...
    
                       She allows him to catch her...
    
                                               RIKER
                                 What I need, I can't get from
                                 Doctor Crusher...

                                 Counselor, do you think it's
                                 possible for two people to go
                                 back in time to fix a mistake
                                 they've made?

                                 On this ship, anything can
                                 happen. And usually does.
    
                       He closes the gap between them, kisses her deeply.
    
                                               TROI
                                 Augh.
    
                                               RIKER
                                 Augh?
    
                                               TROI
                                 I never kissed you with a beard 
                                 before.
    
                       She pushes him out the door...
    
                                               RIKER
                                 I kiss you and you say 'augh'?!
    
                       She hits the panel and the door slides closed in his
                       face... a tiny grin comes to her face...

                                 That's what made Data

                                 Why would they fire at him

                                 And yet he attacked us. And told
                                 the Ba'ku we were a threat...
    
                       'Why?' is the unspoken question on Picard's face.

                       They reach a door with a significant security system in
                       place... Geordi hits several panels... Picard notices his
                       eye discomfort...

                       The door slides open to reveal a closet-sized space with
                       Data mounted on the wall in a diagnostic device... Geordi
                       touches a panel which activates Data...
    
                                               PICARD
                                 Hello, Data...

                       Geordi holds up the damaged components for him to see.

                                 I was in an isolation suit
                                 collecting physiometric data on
                                 Ba'ku children. My last memory
                                 is going into the hills,
                                 following a boy...

                       Artim is playing with a tiny 'palm-pet', a colorful cross
                       between a caterpillar and a jellyfish that crawls over
                       his hand and between his fingers, as Sojef moves over
                       with Picard and Data... the boy looks at Data with fear
                       in his eyes. Data can't help but notice...
    
                                               SOJEF
                                 Artim, do you remember where you
                                 were on the day of lightning
                                 when the artificial lifeform
                                 appeared to us?
    
                                               ARTIM
                                 In the hills, by the dam.
    
                                               PICARD
                                 Can you show us?
    
                       Artim puts his pet in a pocket (or it can have its own
                       little pouch on Artim's belt if he has no pockets) and 
                       leads  the way. Several Ba'ku including Anij and Tournel
                       curiously follow. As Picard makes eye contact with her,
                       she moves over...
    
                                               ANIJ
                                 Haven't you disrupted our lives
                                 enough...?
    
                       She says it gently, but honestly...
    
                                               PICARD
                                 I understand how you feel. We 
                                 just want to retrace Data's
                                 movements that day...
    
                                               ANIJ
                                 Why?
    
                                               PICARD
                                         (a cautious reply)
                                 I don't like to leave questions
                                 unanswered.
    
                                               ANIJ

                                 answering questions.
    
                      She moves away. Picard watches her; she doesn't look
                      back.

                      Who notices Artim still glancing at him with fear. To
                      reassure him --
    
                                               DATA
                                 There is no need for concern. I 
                                 am operating within normal
                                 parameters now.
    
                                               ARTIM
                                 You're what?

                                 I am better.
    
                       The android's manner only seems to frighten Artim more.
                       Before Data can say anything else, Sojef comes and leads
                       him away, giving Data a cool smile that says, in effect,
                       I don't want any artificial lifeform talking to my son.
                       Data reacts. After a thoughtful beat, moves to walk with
                       Picard.

                                 It's nothing personal data. You
                                 have to remember these people
                                 have rejected technology. And
                                 you...
    
                                               DATA
                                 ... I am the personification of 
                                 everything they have rejected.
    
                                               PICARD
                                 Until this week, that young man
                                 probably never saw a  machine, let
                                 alone one that walks and talks...

                                 And I do not believe I made a
                                 very good first impression.
              
                       It clearly bothers Data to be the object of fear. The
                       boy glances over his shoulder once more at the android,
                       looks quickly away...

                       clutter.

                       They come to a brook. Artim hops on one foot across
                       rocks in the water and without stopping to think, Picard
                       does the same thing, looking like a little boy... then
                       notices a curious look from Data which makes him collect
                       himself and adjust his jacket. Anij glances over at
                       Sojef with concern. The others cross in adult fashion.

                       Dougherty in the foreground; behind him a Son'a physician
                       is pulling green scum from subcutaneous boils under the

                       Dougherty exchanges a concerned look with Ru'afo...

                       Picard, Data and the Ba'ku have moved toward a dam where
                       Data is having trouble with is tricorder...

                                 How about a passive radiation

                       Data adjusts his tricorder... reacts...

                                 Curious, there appear to be
                                 strong neutrino emissions coming
                                 from the lake...
    
                       Staying with Data s he follows the tricorder to the edge
                       of the lake... a brief pause... and then in a Harold
                       Lloyd sort of moment, he steps into the lake up to his
                       ankles, pauses again to look at the tricorder and then
                       disappears under water.

                                 Can he breathe under water?

                                 Data doesn't breathe.

                                 Won't he rust?

                       He climbs to the top of the earthen dam and turns a heavy
                       wheel that might usually require the strength of two men,
                       opening a floodgate... as he does --

                       a strange displacement of water appearing as the lake
                       drains... something invisible is sitting in the water...
    
                       a bird lands on top of it... and as the water sinks
                       lower, spilling off the sides of the invisible object,
                       the shape is revealed to be that of a cloaked spaceship.

                       As they move to a rowboat... Artim begins to follow but
                       Sojef puts a firm arm on his shoulder.

                       And she hops onto the rowboat with Picard and Data...
                       decidedly not trusting either of them to go alone...

                                 It might be wiser for you to stay
                                 on shore.
    
                       Anij's answer is to grab an oar and push them away from
                       shore... as Data and Picard exchange a glance, Picard
                       takes the oar from her and...

                       Picard, Anij and Data row closer to the invisible ship.

                       Data presses controls on his tricorder. A hatch opens.
                       Picard and Data draw phasers...

                       As they climb in to find themselves in an identical image
                       of the Ba'ku village. Anij is stunned...

                       shadows of the "village" hologram... and then another and
                       another... the shots hit walls revealing portions of the
                       holo-grid (an effect we will see again later during the
                       final action). Plasma ricochets off the walls spraying
                       sparks over them all... as Data fires back, Picard grabs
                       Anij and shoves her out of the hatch for her safety...

                       A brief, intense exchange of shots... creating more gaps
                       in the holo-image... and finally a Son'a officer falls

                       DECLOAKING... Anij splaying her arms to keep afloat in
                       the water... Picard and Data stick their heads out of the
                       hatch...
    
                                               ANIJ
                                 I can't swim!
    
                       Data and Picard promptly jump in after her...

                                 I've been shot at... thrown into
                                 the lake out of an invisible ship
                                 that's come to abduct us all...
                                 what's there to panic about?

                                 I have been designed to serve as
                                 a floatation device.
    
                       He twists his neck a certain way and we hear a slight
                       technical re-alignment and suddenly he floats...she
                       hangs on as Picard swims over to retrieve the rowboat...

                       red mark on his nose, observes. Picard is still wet and
                       angry... on the move...

                                 Gorch?
    
                       Data leans in and whispers the translation into Picard's
                       ear... Picard is embarrassed he brought it up...
    
                                               PICARD

                                 noticeable...

                       Riker with his clean shaven face moving to meet them...
                       Picard and Data react... Riker smiles...

                       For the rest of the sequence, Data observes Riker's chin.
                       Moving to the turbolift...

                                 Geordi...?
    
                       Geordi turns and Picard reacts as he sees Geordi's
                       eyes... without the implants... Geordi smiles...
                          
                                               LA FORGE
                                 Funniest thing, Captain. There
                                 wasn't anything wrong with my
                                 implants. There was something
                                 right with my eyes. When Doctor
                                 Crusher removed the ocular
                                 connections, she found the cells
                                 around my optic nerves...
    
                                               PICARD
                                 ... had regenerated.
                       
                                               LA FORGE
                                 It may not last after we leave.
                                 If not, I just wanted, before we
                                 go...
                                         (beat)
                                 I've never actually seen a
                                 sunrise.
    
                       Picard considers him a long beat... and they turn to see --
    
                 123   THE SUN - (OPTICAL)                                          123
    
                       cracking the horizon turning the lake red...
    
                 124   PICARD AND GEORDI                                            124
    
                       bathed in the sunlight... Picard's face looking younger,
                       contented in the new sun...
    
                 125   THE SUNRISE - VARIOUS SHOTS                                  125
    
                       ... the silhouette of an eagle-like bird coasting a foot
                       above the water... the morning breeze brushing the red-
                       tinged field of tall grass.
    
                 126   GEORDI                                                       126
    
                       A tear rolls down his cheek...
    
                 127   WIDE - (OPTICAL)                                             127
    
                       as the sunlight cascades over the village and hills and
                       if we weren't sure this place was magic before, we
                       certainly know it now.
    
                 128   EXT. SPACE - THE FOUR SON'A SHIPS - (OPTICAL)                128
    
                       dwarf the Enterprise as they move into orbit...
      
                 129   INT. READY ROOM (OPTICAL)                                    129
    
                       Dougherty and Ru'afo enter... Ru'afo is furious --
    
                                               RU'AFO
                                 Am I to understand you're
                                 not releasing my men, Captain?
    
                       Picard at his desk working, looks up, makes strong eye
                       contact with his guests...
    
                                               PICARD
                                         (quietly)
                                 I found the holoship.
    
                       That stops Ru'afo. He looks at Dougherty who realizes
                       some damage control will be necessary...
    
                                               DOUGHERTY
                                 Ru'afo, why don't you let the 
                                 Captain and I...
    
                       Ru'afo's face is so tight it seems it's going to break...
    
                                               RU'AFO
                                 No!
    
                       ... and it does -- a crack opens up from his forehead to
                       his chin and blood dribbles out of it...
    
                                               RU'AFO (CONT'D)
                                 This entire mission has been one
                                 Federation blunder after another.
                                 You will return my men or this
                                 alliance will end with the
                                 destruction of your ship.
    
                       He exits. Dougherty measures Picard for a beat...
    
                                               DOUGHERTY
                                 You're looking well, Jean-Luc.
                                 Rested.
    
                                               PICARD
                                 Your "Briar Patch" turned out to
                                 be more hospitable than I
                                 expected.
    
                                               DOUGHERTY
                                         (nods)
                                 That's why we put chromodynamic
                                 shields in place - so our people
                                 wouldn't feel the effects from
                                 the metaphasic radiation...
    
                                               PICARD
                                 ... or understand that they were
                                 participating in the outright
                                 theft of a world.
                                         (beat)
                                 I won't let you move them,
                                 Admiral. I'll go to the
                                 Federation Council...
    
                                               DOUGHERTY
                                 I'm acting on orders form the
                                 Federation Council.
    
                                               PICARD
                                         (reacts, beat)
                                 How can there be an order to
                                 abandon the Prime Directive...?
    
                                               DOUGHERTY
                                 The Prime Directive doesn't
                                 apply. These people are not
                                 indigenous to this world. They
                                 were never meant to be immortal.
                                 We'll simply be restoring their
                                 natural evolution.

                                 Who are we to decide the next
                                 course of evolution for these
                                 people?
    
                                               DOUGHERTY
                                 There are six hundred people down
                                 there. We'll be able to use the
                                 regenerative properties of this
                                 radiation to help billions.

                                 The Son'a have developed a

                                 Right. We have the planet and
                                 they have the technology -- a
                                 technology we can't duplicate.
                                 You know what that makes us?

                                 Our partners are nothing more
                                 than petty thugs.

                                 Warp drive transformed a bunch of

                                 Someone probably said the same
                                 thing about the Romulans a

                                 With metaphasics, lifespans will

                                 I understand your Chief Engineer
                                 has the use of his eyes for the
                                 first time in his life... would
                                 you take his sight away from him?

                                 There are metaphasic particles
                                 all over The Briar Patch. Why
                                 must this planet be...

                                 The concentration in the rings is
                                 what makes the whole damned thing
                                 work. Don't ask me to explain
                                 it. I only know they inject
                                 something into the rings that
                                 starts a thermolytic reaction.
                                 After it's over, the planet will
                                 be unlivable for generations.

                                 Our best scientific minds already
                                 have. We can't find any other

                                 Then the Son'a can establish a

                                 their condition. Some of them
                                 won't survive that long.
                                 Besides, they don't want to live

                       Picard and Dougherty look at each other a long beat.
                                     
                                               PICARD
                                 We are betraying the principles
                                 upon which the Federation was
                                 founded... this is an attack on
                                 the very soul of the Federation.
                                         (beat)
                                 This will destroy the Ba'ku.
                                 Just as cultures have been 
                                 destroyed in every other forced
                                 relocation throughout history.
    
                                               DOUGHERTY
                                 We are only moving six hundred
                                 people, Jean-Luc.
    
                                               PICARD
                                         (beat)
                                 How many people would it take...
                                 before it becomes wrong? A
                                 thousand? Fifty thousand. A
                                 million?
    
                       Dougherty has taken this as far as he intends to.
    
                                               DOUGHERTY
                                 I'm ordering you to the Goren
                                 system. File whatever protests
                                 you wish to. By the time you do,
                                 this will be all done.
                                         (moves to exit)
                                 I'm also ordering the release of
                                 the Son'a officers.
    
                       He's out. Picard sits at his desk for a long beat...
    
                 130   INT. BRIDGE                                                  130
    
                       Worf at Conn, Data at Ops, Riker at command... they look
                       up at Picard as he comes out of the Ready Room.
    
                                               PICARD
                                 Prepare the ship for departure at
                                 oh-seven-hundred hours.
    
                                               RIKER
                                 Aye, sir.
    
                       Data exchanges a curious glance with Riker as Picard
                       crosses to the turbolift. Before he gets in, he turns
                       and looks at his bridge, imprinting it on his mind.
     
                 131   INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS                                       131
    
                       as he enters, stands in the middle of the room a long
                       beat, his table still cluttered with charts and PADDS...
    
                 132   ANGLE - CLOSEUP - HIS DRESSER                                132
    
                       One pip is placed on top, a second, third and fourth...
    
                 133   INT. SON'A BODY SCULPTURE CHAMBER - CLOSE ON A TOOTH         133
                       (OPTICAL)
    
                       as it's implanted into a very old man's mouth and now,
                       the old fellow has a mouthful of bright new teeth...
                       Gallatin enters, moving to --
    
                 134   RU'AFO - (OPTICAL)                                           134
    
                       sitting, his head locked in position by an apparatus... a
                       female attendant actually giving him a facelift in front
                       of our eyes... the device stretching his face ever
                       tighter, as she snips off skin by one ear with a laser in
                       a bloodless surgery that heals his wound...
    
                                               RU'AFO
                                 Gallatin! So the righteous
                                 Starfleet Captain finally
                                 released you. Did you encounter
                                 any problems on the surface?
    
                                               GALLATIN
                                         (acknowledges)
                                 No, sir. But it wasn't easy...
                                 being among them...
    
                                               RU'AFO
                                 I'm sure. Just don't forget what
                                 they did to us.
                                         (Gallatin nods)
                                 We'll have them rounded up in a
                                 day or two... we needn't bother
                                 with the Federation holo-ship
                                 any more. Just get the holding
                                 cells ready.
    
                       Gallatin acknowledges, leaves. To the attendant -
    
                                              RU'AFO
                                 I'm going to miss these little
                                 flesh-stretching sessions of
                                 ours, my dear.
    
                        As she pulls up his other ear...
    
                 135   INT. YACHT COCKPIT - (OPTICAL)                               135
    
                       Picard, out of uniform, works a transporter and cases of
                       military supplies MATERIALIZE on a loading platform that
                       will lower into the cargo hold of the yacht... he studies
                       a translucent geological scan of the surface that we will
                       hear more about later...
    
                                               DATA (O.C.)
                                 Re-routing the transport grid to
                                 avoid detection was wise, sir,
                                 but the transporter is rarely
                                 used after oh-two-hundred hours.
    
                       Picard turns to see Data, Troi, Crusher, La Forge, Worf
                       and Riker have entered the hatch. All but Riker and
                       Geordi are out of uniform.
    
                                               TROI
                                 Taking the Captain's yacht out
                                 for a spin?
    
                                               WORF
                                         (examining the cargo)
                                 Seven metric tons of ultritium
                                 explosives, eight tetryon pulse
                                 launchers, ten isomagnetic
                                 disintegrators...
    
                                               RIKER
                                 You must be planning on doing
                                 some hunting.
    
                                               PICARD
                                 Go back to your quarters
                                         (no one moves)
                                 That's an order.
    
                       No one moves.
    
                                               RIKER
                                 No uniform? No orders.
    
                       Geordi, with his normal eyes, moves forward...
    
                                               LA FORGE
                                 How could I look at another
                                 sunrise, knowing what my sight
                                 cost these people, Captain?
    
                       Picard looks at them with appreciation.
    
                                               DATA
                                 I feel obliged to point out that
                                 the environmental anomalies may
                                 be stimulating certain rebellious
                                 instincts common to youth that
                                 could affect everyone's judgment.
                                 Except mine, of course.
    
                                               CRUSHER
                                 Okay, Data, what do you think we
                                 should do?
    
                       Data looks to everyone, considering a beat... picks up a
                       phaser rifle... activates it...
    
                                               DATA
                                 Saddle up. Lock and load.
    
                       The family united looks to their Captain for
                       instructions. Picard looks to them with deep affection.
    
                                               PICARD
                                 They won't begin the procedure
                                 while the planet is inhabited.
                                 So, our job is to keep the planet
                                 inhabited.
    
                       He looks at Riker and La Forge, knowing that his first
                       officer and chief engineer must stay with the ship.
    
                                               PICARD (CONT'D)
                                 Go back and put a face on what's
                                 happening here. Make the Council
                                 see the Ba'ku. It's too easy to
                                 turn a blind eye to the suffering
                                 of an unfamiliar people.
    
                       Riker and La Forge acknowledge. Picard takes an extra
                       moment to look, perhaps for the last time, into the eyes
                       of his first officer with affection...
    
                                               PICARD
                                 There's a short letter I left you
                                 all, just some... sentimental
                                 nonsense... the computer will
                                 bring it to your attention at oh-
                                 four-hundred... I'd just as soon
                                 you delete it...
    
                                               RIKER
                                 Fat chance. I'll post it on
                                 every monitor on the ship...
    
                       Picard grins with nice embarrassment, then with a serious
                       look to Riker --
    
                                               PICARD
                                 We'll hold out as long as we can.
    
                       Riker understands they're counting on him. Picard hits a
                       panel and the weapons sink into the yacht...
    
                       as the non-uniformed officers move to take their posts,
                       Riker takes Troi in his arms, kisses her good-bye. The
                       others react in surprise.
    
                                               DATA
                                 Apparently the environmental
                                 anomalies are also stimulating...
                       
                       Worf shuts him up with a hard look... Data gets the
                       message, sits in a cockpit chair and quietly begins to
                       work...

                       falls away from the belly of the mother ship...
    
                       and after a beat, the thrusters ignite and off they go...

                       Ru'afo watches a realistic simulation of a space
                       procedure on a monitor... a small but sophisticated
                       injector assembly sailing into the planet's rings begins
                       to fire charges that start a thermolytic reaction (we see

                                 Sir, as the Enterprise left
                                 orbit, one of their support craft
                                 went down to the surface.
                                         (Ru'afo reacts, takes
                                           the PADD)
                                 It appeared to be the Captain's
                                 Yacht. Five persons on board.

                                 Gallatin, if Picard or any of his
                                 people interfere... eliminate
                                 them.

                       On a door opening... as we hear a bell ringing... the
                       face of Artim fills the screen... his eyes scared... and
                       as we reveal his point of view of the village, it's a
                       stunning sight -- Tournel pulling on the warning bell in
                       the square... hundreds of people moving with urgency...
                       supplies are being packed onto the backs of llamas...
                       Worf, Data and Troi are unpacking the cases of military
                       supplies that have already been loaded from the
                       (unseen) yacht... Picard is going over charts with Anij 
                       and Sojef near-by...

                                 What's happened? Is something
                                 wrong?

                                 We're leaving the village...

                       Artim jumps with a start as a slim, high-tech device on a
                       stake suddenly lights up like a Christmas tree beside
                       him... sees Data who just activated it...
    
                                               DATA
                                 It is a transport inhibitor. It
                                 will help prevent Son'a ships
                                 from beaming anyone off the
                                 surface...
    
                       Artim, overwhelmed and still scared of the android, backs
                       away from Data without responding and moves toward his
                       father. Picard is showing Anij and Sojef the translucent
                       geo-scans we saw on the yacht...

                                 the deposits the more trouble
                                 they'll have with their
                                 transporters... our route will
                                 keep us close to these
                                 deposits as possible...

                                 inhibitors to compensate. The
                                 mountains have the highest

                                 there, transport will be
                                 virtually impossible...

                       The mass of people cross the fields.. the Starfleet
                       officers separated at intervals among them, continuing to
                       encourage and assist them forward... progress slows as

                       As another wave of ships passes over, suddenly, with the

                       DEMATERIALIZATIONS in the same gap continue, suddenly
                       Sojef is beamed away...

                       surge even harder forward toward the protection of the
                       next inhibitor and now the boy is thrust to the ground.
                       As he falls, the little palm-pet slips out of his
                       pocket... Artim desperately tries to save him from being
                       stepped on, finally snatches him in his hand. But now
                       the crush of people threatens to trample the boy and it's
                       a reminder how scary it can be to be small. Suddenly, an
                       arm reaches down and scoops him up... and as we follow

                                 Talk... we should send down an
                                 assault team and take them by
                                 force.

                                 That is not an acceptable option.
                                 If people get hurt, all the
                                 support we have in the 
                                 Federation...
    
                                               RU'AFO
                                 Federation support, Federation
                                 procedures, Federation rules...
                                 look in the mirror, Admiral...
                                 the Federation is old... in the
                                 last twenty four months, it's
                                 been challenged by every major
                                 power in the quadrant -- the
                                 Borg, the Cardassians, the
                                 Dominion... they all smell the
                                 scent of death on the Federation.
                                 That's why you've embraced our
                                 offer... because it will give
                                 your dear Federation new life.
                                 Well, how badly do you want it,
                                 Admiral? Because there are hard
                                 choices to be made now. If the
                                 Enterprise gets through with news
                                 about their brave Captain's
                                 valiant struggle on behalf of the
                                 defenseless Ba'ku, your
                                 Federation politicians will
                                 waver, your Federation opinion
                                 polls will open a public debate,
                                 your Federation allies will want
                                 their say... need I go on?
    
                       Dougherty takes a deep breath... knows Ru'afo is right.
                       Gallatin hates the idea of a violent assault, gives
                       Dougherty the other option he's desperately seeking --
    
                                               GALLATIN
                                 There is an alternative to an all-
                                 out assault. Isolinear tags
                                 would allow our transporters to
                                 lock on to them.
    
                                               RU'AFO
                                 We'd have to tag every one of
                                 them... that would take time...
                                 and we don't have it. The
                                 Enterprise is only nineteen hours
                                 from communications range with
                                 the Federation...
    
                                               DOUGHERTY
                                 I'll order Riker to turn around.
    
                                               RU'AFO
                                 Picard's first officer. Do you
                                 really believe he'll listen?
    
                       Ru'afo's clearly lost faith in the Admiral's ability to
                       control the situation... Dougherty's jaw tightens...
    
                                               RU'AFO
                                 My ships are capable of
                                 intercepting the Enterprise
                                 before it reaches the perimeter.
                                 I could send them to... escort...
                                 it back... but Commander Riker
                                 might not want to come...
    
                       And we slowly push into Dougherty as he steps across his
                       self-imposed moral line...
    
                                               DOUGHERTY
                                 Send your ships.
    
                       Dougherty tries to digest the knot in his stomach...

                       path below as hundreds of Ba'ku and dozens of llamas wind
                       their way up... it's almost biblical in scope with Picard

                       struggling inside to reconcile what he's been taught
                       about machines and the experience he's had with Data...

                       They exchange a glance. Artim sighs, troubled.

                                 machines. There was even a 
                                 big fight about it once.

                       notice more physical changes in our people because of the

                       darker and there actually seems to be a touch more of it
                       growing than before... Worf's hair is more straggly,

                       Picard, and we, find ourselves in a heightened state of
                       sensory perception -- time seems to be slowing down to a

                       beating slowly with a booming percussion... he follows her 
                       gaze to see yet another humming bird, hears its languid wing
                       motion... swirling dust from the mountain seems like a 
                       zipping scarf in a breeze that plays in his ears like a
                       natural flute... his breath becomes more even as he
                       relaxes into this altered state and he feels...

                       brush his cheek, his lips... her teeth nip gently on his
                       lower lip, tugging it and then her lips press against his
                       for an eternity...

                       Both catch seriously on fire. After a beat, one explodes

                       moves to Picard. Just outside the new exit, a series of

                       scans the unconscious Son'a with a tricorder. Her eyes

                       is impossible, she checks again.

                       He looks at the tricorder, reacts incredulously...

                       where Anij and Tournel are assisting the last Ba'ku out

                       can't find it... he reacts... he moves into the main
                       cavern away from the others... a beat later, Anij and

                       Picard... running now... coming this way... suddenly,
                       wham... a rocket hits the mountainside and the ground
                       shudders... and the ceiling starts to collapse... and...

                       Picard reaches out for her... just as the whole thing
                       comes down on both of them... Picard throws Artim out of
                       the cave just in front of the collapse into the arms
                       of...

                       who pulls him safely away from the collapse... The

                                 Worf to Picard...
    
                                               PICARD
                                 Yes... yes, I... can hear you...

                                 We're trying to get to you,
                                 sir...
    
                       Picard begins to crawl around in the darkness and finally
                       comes to motionless body of Anij...
    
                                               PICARD
                                 Anij.
    
                       She barely opens her eyes... Picard looks to see if he
                       still has his tricorder; he does... he trains it on
                       her... the reading are not good...
    
                                               PICARD
                                 Help is coming.
    
                       She looks at him and tries to smile, but it's too much...
                       and her eyes close... and the tricorder tells Picard
                       she's on the edge of death...
                                            
                                               PICARD
                                 Worf, you must hurry...

                                         (beat)
                                 I'm losing her.

                                 We're coming.
    
                       Picard takes Anij's hand and holds it to his own cheek...
    
                                               PICARD
                                 Stay with me... don't let go of
                                 this moment, Anij... help me find
                                 the power to make you live in
                                 this moment... just one more
                                 moment... and then one more after
                                 that... and one more after that.
    
                       Her eyes weakly open one last time and look at him...and
                       as their eyes connect... once again...
    
                 229   HIS POV (OPTICAL)                                            229
    
                       as his consciousness moves down her arm and as the bond
                       is formed... he experiences --
       
                 230   AN ALTERED REALITY - (OPTICAL)                               230
    
                       with heightened senses again as time seems to slow down,
                       her eyelids thumping slowly louder and louder... and as
                       they hold the moment the cavern seems to light up with
                       the metaphysical energy they're emanating... and it's
                       like Picard has thrown her a mystical lifeline to hold
                       onto... his eyes are her eyes as life seeps into them...
                       the moment seems to last forever... she smiles gently and
                       finally sunlight cracks into the cavern as Data and Worf
                       break through... Crusher crawls in and uses the
                       hypospray an Anij's neck... measures her lifesigns with
                       the tricorder, smiles at Picard...
    
                                               CRUSHER
                                 She's stabilizing.
    
                                               PICARD
                                 Is it safe to move her?
    
                                               CRUSHER
                                 Safer than leaving her here.
    
                       Picard kneels and picks her up in his arms... Anij looks
                       weakly at him...
    
                                               ANIJ
                                 And you thought it would take
                                 centuries to learn.
    
                       He smiles with affection at her... and they all exit...

                       as Beverly, Worf, Troi, Data and Picard, carrying Anij,
                       come out to cross the divide... and they stop dead in
                       their tracks... as they see --

                       menacingly between them and the safety of the mountain
                       caverns... and as we intercut between the drones and
    
                 233   THE FACES OF OUR HEROES                                      233
    
                       we understand a classic showdown is imminent... an
                       O.K. Corral moment... and all this happens very fast: our
                       people stand shoulder to shoulder each a yard apart...
                       Picard gently lowers Anij to the ground... Worf tosses
                       him a spare phaser rifle... as he catches it...

                       Our people react... move, duck and roll, tags just
                       missing them, as they fire back... only Picard stands
                       motionless on one knee protecting Anij... one, two,
                       three, four drones are destroyed but the fifth fires,
                       tagging Anij... Picard instantly reaches for her tag, but
                       then he feels the sting of...
    
                 239   CLOSE - A TAG                                                239
    
                       on the side of his jacket; he reaches to pull it off but
                       it's too late...

                       escorted by Gallatin, enters a cavernous brig filled with
                       Ba'ku, perhaps as many as eighty of them...his eyes
                       looking for --
    
                 243   ANGLE - PICARD                                               243
    
                       stroking Anij's hair as she lies weakly next to him and
                       Sojef. A beat as he locks eyes with Dougherty.
    
                                               DOUGHERTY
                                 Order them to surrender, and I
                                 promise you won't be court-
                                 martialed.
    
                                               PICARD
                                 If a court-martial is the only
                                 way to tell the people of the
                                 Federation what happened here,
                                 then I welcome it.
    
                       Ru'afo enters, controlled rage, hands a PADD to
                       Dougherty.
    
                                               RU'AFO
                                 The Enterprise has destroyed one
                                 of my ships. The other is on
                                 fire, requesting assistance.
    
                       A beat. Picard reacts as Dougherty studies the PADD.
    
                                               PICARD
                                         (to Dougherty)
                                 The Enterprise would only fire if
                                 it were defending itself. Ru'afo
                                 must have ordered the attack.
                                         (beat)
                                 I can't believe he would've given
                                 that order without your consent,
                                 Admiral.
    
                       Dougherty maintains eye contact but has completely lost
                       his dignity...
    
                                               PICARD
                                 I wonder... which one of us will be
                                 facing that court-martial...
              
                                              DOUGHERTY
                                         (to Ru'afo)
                                 There's nothing further to be
                                 gained from this...
    
                                               RU'AFO
                                 You're right. This is going to
                                 end now.
                                         (to Picard)
                                 The Ba'ku want to stay on the
                                 planet. Let them. I'm going to
                                 launch the injector...
    
                       Gallatin's face reacts to that...Picard sees his sharp
                       displeasure and then for an instant their eyes meet.
                       Gallatin looks away, but Picard registers the
                       information.
    
                                               DOUGHERTY
                                 You're not going to launch 
                                 anything until...
    
                                               RU'AFO
                                 In six hours, every living thing
                                 in this system will be dead or
                                 dying.
    
                       He starts to exit...
    
                                               PICARD
                                 You would kill your own people,
                                 Ru'afo? Your own parents, your
                                 brothers, sisters...
                                         (off Dougherty's look)
                                 Didn't you know, Admiral? The
                                 Ba'ku and the Son'a are the same
                                 race.
    
                       Dougherty, confused, looks to Ru'afo... who doesn't look
                       back... Sojef stands and comes forward... to Ru'afo --
    
                                               SOJEF
                                 Which one were you? Gal'na...
                                 Ro'tin...Belath'nin... I'm
                                 sorry, I don't recognize you...
    
                                               RU'AFO
                                 Those names, those children are
                                 gone forever.

                                 What is he talking about?
    
                                               SOJEF
                                 A century ago, a group of our
                                 young people wanted to follow the
                                 ways of the offlanders. They
                                 tried to take over the colony...
                                 and when they failed...
    
                                               RU'AFO
                                 When we failed, you exiled us.
                                 To die slowly.
             
                       Anij gathers the strength to look at him...
    
                                               ANIJ
                                 You're Ro'tin, aren't you...?
                                 There's something in the voice.
                                         (to Gallatin)
                                 Would you be his friend Gal'na?
                                         (Gallatin looks away)
                                 I helped your mother bathe you
                                 when you were a child. She still
                                 speaks of you.
    
                                               PICARD
                                         (to Dougherty)
                                 You've brought the Federation
                                 into the middle of a blood feud,
                                 Admiral. The children have
                                 returned to expel their elders...
                                 just as they were once expelled.
                                 Except Ru'afo's need for revenge
                                 has now escalated to parricide.
    
                       Ru'afo exits. Gallatin looks at Sojef and then follows.
                       Dougherty is a lost man, realizing his tragic errors.
    
                                               DOUGHERTY
                                 It was for the Federation. It
                                 was all for the Federation.
    
                       Picard offers no sympathy... Dougherty turns and exits...
    
                 244   INT. SON'A BODY SCULPTURE CHAMBER - (OPTICAL)                244
    
                       Deserted as Ru'afo enters, his face full of tension... he
                       moves to a device that bombards his face with pulsating
                       green energy, trying to relax... Dougherty enters...
    
                                               DOUGHERTY
                                 We're taking this ship out of
                                 here... this mission is over...
    
                                               RU'AFO
                                 It is not over.
    
                                               DOUGHERTY
                                 It is over.
    
                       Ru'afo moves away from the device and grabs Dougherty
                       roughly... moving him across the room...
    
                                               RU'AFO
                                 I do not take orders from you.
                                  
                                               DOUGHERTY
                                 If you begin the procedure while
                                 the planet is still populated,
                                 the Federation will pursue you
                                 until...
    
                       Ru'afo, more powerful than Dougherty, throws him down
                       into one of the treatment chairs...
    
                                               RU'AFO
                                 The Federation...
    
                       He locks Dougherty's head into the device... switches
                       several panels... the device lights up ominously...
    
                                               RU'AFO (CONT'D)
                                 ... will never know what happened
                                 here.
    
                       He hits a switch and begins to raise Dougherty's ears in
                       the facelift procedure we saw before... Dougherty
                       struggles but Ru'afo holds him down... as the Admiral's
                       twists and morphs into a grotesque facelift that
                       finally strangles him to death.

                       Ru'afo enters...Gallatin and officers on duty...
    
                                               RU'AFO
                                 Admiral Dougherty will not be
                                 joining us for diner. Deploy
                                 the collector.
                                         (Gallatin hesitates)
                                 Do you have a problem with those
                                 orders?
    
                                               GALLATIN
                                 May I talk to you alone?
    
                                               RU'AFO
                                         (to another officer)
                                 Deploy the collector.
    
                       The officer complies.
    
                                               GALLATIN
                                 Moving them is one thing.
                                 Killing them all...
    
                                               RU'AFO
                                 No one hated them more than you,
                                 Gal'na.
                                         (beat, intimately)
                                 We've come a long way together.
                                 This is the moment we've planned
                                 for so many years...
    
                       Gallatin looks at his friend, his commander... Ru'afo
                       pats him encouragingly on the shoulder...
    
                                               RU'AFO
                                 Separate the Starfleet personnel
                                 and secure them in the aft cargo
                                 hold... see that Picard joins
                                 them...
    
                                               GALLATIN
                                 The shields in that section won't
                                 protect them against the
                                 thermolytic reaction...
    
                                               RU'AFO
                                 Thank-you for reminding me.
    
                       He sits in his command seat and watches his viewscreen...

                       (OPTICAL)
    
                       as huge hatches open and the particle collector that will
                       capture the metaphasic radiation from the rings slowly
                       extends out in both directions. After a beat, Gallatin
                       exits... push in to Ru'afo...
    
                 247   INT. COLLECTOR - (OPTICAL)                                   247
    
                       an Astrodome-sized chamber full of weird crisscrossing
                       patterns of pipes, conduits, cables, and rails -- all of
                       them stretching slowing outward as the collector expands.

                       begin to unfurl majestically in front of the planet's
                       rings... and now we recognize it as the remarkable device
                       we saw earlier in Ru'afo's simulation.

                       Picard has climbed the rear wall with help from two
                       Ba'ku, examines the forcefield generators in the ceiling.
    
                                               ANIJ

                       Gallatin arrives... armed with a hand weapon. Aiming it
                       at Picard, he turns off the forcefield...
    
                                               GALLATIN
                                 Come with me.
    
                       Picard measures him for a moment then comes out, smiles
                       'don't worry' to Anij... Gallatin restores the field and
                       motions for Picard to exit...

                       walking to a turbolift... unusually cordial considering
                       the circumstances --
    
                                               PICARD
                                 It must have been very strange
                                 for you.
                                         (off his look)
                                 When you were a hostage. Being
                                 among the friends and families
                                 you knew so many years ago. All
                                 of them looking exactly as they
                                 did. Almost like... looking
                                 through the eyes of childhood
                                 again.
    
                       Gallatin presses a panel at the lift... Picard fixes his
                       eyes on him, evenly --
    
                                               PICARD
                                 And here you are trying to close
                                 those eyes again... to pretend
                                 you can't see what the bitterness
                                 has done to your people... what
                                 it's done to Ru'afo... and to
                                 you
                                         (beat)
                                 It's turned you... into a coward.
                                         (off his reaction)
                                 A man who ignores his conscience.
    
                       The turbolift arrives...
    
                                               GALLATIN
                                Get in.
    
                       Picard enters...

                                               PICARD
                                 A coward... without the moral
                                 courage to stop an unspeakable
                                 atrocity. You offend me.
    
                                               GALLATIN
                                         (incredulous)
                                 Is this how a Federation officer
                                 begs for his life?
    
                                               PICARD
                                 I'm not begging for my life. I'm
                                 begging for yours.
                                         (beat)
                                 There is still a way home,
                                 Gal'na.
    
                       Gallatin looks at Picard a long, miserable beat, then...

                       inserts the tool and removes the panel cover to expose

                       Ru'afo by the neck and yanks his head down hard against

                       away with him, he takes us to Gallatin watching the
                       children play tag in the high grass with a personal
                       longing.

                       They pause as they notice Crusher escorting a young Ba'ku
                       woman... returning from the mountains... she tries to
                       recognize Gallatin... we're too far away to hear what is
                       said... but the woman embraces Gallatin as a mother
                       embraces a lost son... and Crusher looks over and smiles
                       to Picard... before she leaves the couple alone...  Anij

                       Sojef considers Picard, shakes his hand with a unstated
                       but deep appreciation for all that this offlander has
                       done. He moves away to join Gallatin and his mother.
                       Anij looks to Picard with love.

                       anticipated that he has to go.

                                 on this planet.
                       
                                               QUARK
                                 Do I know you?
    
                                               PICARD
                                         (ignoring the
                                          question)
                                 This world is about to become a
                                 Federation protectorate, which
                                 will end any and all attempts at
                                 exploitation by people like you.
    
                                               QUARK
                                 Explain to me how five thousand
                                 time-share units... right there
                                 along the lake... would be
                                 'exploiting' anyone.
    
                                               PICARD
                                 Mister Worf, have this
                                 uninvited... offlander and his
                                 quests beamed to the Enterprise.
                                 We'll deposit them at Deep Space
                                 Nine.
    
                                               WORF
                                 Must you, sir?
    
                       Worf takes Quark away by the scruff of his beach shirt...
                       his disappointed babes follow ...trailing away --
    
                                               QUARK
                                 You'll hear from my Nagus.
    
                       They're gone.
    
                                               ANIJ
                                 Do you really think your mighty
                                 Federation would be interested in
                                 protecting six hundred people?
    
                                               PICARD
                                 The "mighty" Federation could
                                 learn a few things from this
                                 village...
    
                       He kisses her. The signature humming bird appears,
                       sweeping up in the breeze and hovers briefly in front of
                       them... and as he takes her hand to his cheek...
    
                 307   THE HUMMING BIRD (OPTICAL)                                   307
    
                       slows... its wing movements becoming more fluid and
                       gentle... as the moment extends...
    
                 308   ANGLE ON TROI, CRUSHER, WORF, LA FORGE AND RIKER             308
                       
                       prepared to transport...
    
                                               LA FORGE
                                 Where's Data?
    
                 309   ANGLE - THE HIGH GRASS                                       309
    
                       a shot like our opening shot...except the head that
                       peeks through the grass this time is Data's... and as we
                       widen, we see he has taken Artim's earlier advice and is
                       playing tag with all the kids...
    
                                               CRUSHER
                                         (calling)
                                 Data! It's time to go!
    
                       Data stands up straight as he hears the voice, looks at
                       Artim a long beat... and this is a kid's moment,
                       underplaying the sentiment the way kids would...
    
                                               DATA
                                 I have to go home now.
    
                                               ARTIM
                                 Bye.
    
                       Data nods...
    
                                               DATA
                                 Bye.
    
                       Artim smiles as Data joins the others...
    
                                               ARTIM
                                 Don't forget -- you've got to 
                                 play a little bit every day.
    
                       Data acknowledges...
    
                                               RIKER
                                 Good advice.
    
                       Riker takes Troi's hand suggesting perhaps a new
                       permanent commitment. Picard moves to join the others,
                       presses his combadge.
    
                                               PICARD
                                 Enterprise... seven to beam up.
                                 Energize.
    
                       Picard exchanges a final look with Anij as they
                       DEMATERIALIZE.
    
                 310   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE - (OPTICAL)                      310
    
                       leaves orbit and as it moves into space...
    
                       FADE OUT.
    
                                               _THE END_
