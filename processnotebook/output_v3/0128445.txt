    INT. CLASSROOM - EVENING
    
    A modern day classroom. Twenty-tenth grade boys are sitting in
    desks in geometry class. They are dressed in school uniform, light
    blue shirts and khakis. The boy looks dazed and sleepy.
    
    The teacher, Mr Adams, is at the front of the room, finishing a
    complicating equation on the chalkboard.
    
            	     MR ADAMS
    	Except when the value of the x co-ordinate 
            is less then or equal to the value of the -
    	Yes, Isaac?
    
    A boy named Isaac has raised his hand.
    
                         ISAAC
            That's one fine frame.  A fine
            frame it is.
    
    Isaac points to a startling and intricate arrangement of huge
    numbers and strange symbols filling up the forgotten corner of
    the chalkboard. The heading above it says 'Extra Credit'.
    
                        MR ADAMS
            Oh, I really just put that up there
    	as a joke. That's probably the hardest
    	geometry equation in the world.
    
                        ISAAC
    	How much extra credit is it worth?
    
                        MR ADAMS
            Well. I've never seen anyone get it
            before, including my mentor Dr Leaky
            at MIT. So I guess if anyone here
            can do it.
    	       (pause)
            I'll make sure none of you ever have
            to open another math book again for
            the rest of your lives.
    
    There is some quiet murmuring. The name Fisher is repeated over
    and over. The boys begin to look to a student in the back row.
    
    Unlike his classmates, he wears the Rushmore school blazer with
    insignia in the breast and a Rushmore rep tie knotted tightly.
    His hair is smartly parted and swept back. He is extremely skinny
    and pale. He is Max Fisher.
    
    Max has a cup of coffee on his desk and he is reading the Wall 
    Street Journal.
    
                        MR ADAMS
            Max? You want to try it?
    
    Max looks up.
    
                        MAX
            I'm sorry. Did someone say my name?
    
    Everyone laughs. Max smiles slightly. He buttons his blazer and
    straightens his tie. His picks up his cup of coffee and takes a 
    sip. He goes to the chalkboard and sets to work.
    
    The boys watch with nervous anticipation. Mr Adams compares Max's
    progress with the notes in his book. Max's equation quickly fills
    up most of the board. He finishes it with a flourish, throws his
    piece of chalk in the trash, and turns to face the class.
    
    The classroom erupts into wild, ecstatic applause. Everyone
    surrounded Max, cheering as he walks calmly back to his desk. They
    hoist him into the air.
    
                                                            CUT TO:
    
    Max with his eyes closed, smiling serenely, listening to the
    applause. He mutters.
    
                        MAX
            Gentlemen, gentlemen, please.
    
    A little hand grabs Max's arm and shakes him. Max opens his eyes.
    The person shaking him is his chapel partner, Dirk Calloway, a
    fourth grader with nearly white hair. Max looks around.
    
    They are in a chapel, surrounded by rows of boys in school uniform.
    Dirk puts his finger to his lips.
    
                        DIRK
            Ssh.
    
    Max rubs his eyes and sits up in the pew. The applause dies down and
    Max looks up to the pulpit as the guest chapel speaker, Herman Blume,
    steps up to the microphone.
    
    Mr Blume is a tough-looking guy about fifty years old in a black suit.
    He begins his chapel speech.
    
                       MR BLUME
            You guys have it real easy. I never
     	had it like this where I grew up.
    	But I send my kids here. Because the
    	fact is, whether you deserve it or
    	not; you go to one of the best 
            schools in this country.
    
    Max's eyes light up.
    
                       MR BLUME
            Rushmore. You lucked out.
    
    Max leans forward to the railing and begins to listen intently.
    
                       MR BLUME
            Now for some of you it doesn't matter
    	You were born rich and you're going to
    	stay rich. But here's my advice to the
    	rest of you: take dead aim on the rich
    	boys. Get them in the cross-hairs. And
    	take them down.
    
    Some of the students and faculty begin to look at each other with
    puzzled expressions. Max is nodding and taking notes on the flypage
    of a hymnal.
    
    	INSERT HYMNAL:
    
    		Rushmore - best school in country.
    		rich kids - bad?
    
    Mr Blume leaves the podium. Max leaps to his feet and leads the
    big applause. The organ starts and everyone stands up.
    
    EXT. QUADRANGLE - DAY
    
    Mr Blume and the headmaster, Dr Guggenheim, come out of the chapel
    among the throng of students.
                                
    Dr Guggenheim wears a wool coat and smokes a pipe. He is very
    dashing with silver hear and a warmly patronizing manner. He walks
    with his hands clasped behind his back.
    
                       DR GUGGENHEIM
            Are you free for graduation, Herman?
    	Maybe you could give us an encore.
    	      (whistles to the dog)
    	Nicholas! Copernicus!
    
                       MR BLUME
                  (lighting a cigarette)
    	I don't give a shit. I paid for the
    	whole damn natatorium. The least these
    	little pricks can do is hear me out.
    
                       MAX
            Mr Blume. 
                    
    Max has appeared beside him. Dirk tags along behind him.
    
                       MAX
            My name is Max Fisher. I just wanted
    	to tell you, I strongly agree with
    	your views concerning Rushmore.
    
                       MR BLUME
            You don't say. Tell me something. How
    	long have you gone here?
    
    		   MAX
    	Ten years.
    
    		   MR BLUME
    	Then you've been in a dreamworld for
    	ten years.
    		   MAX
    	I know it, sir.
    
    Max smiles broadly. They each notice that their haircuts are 
    identical, neatly parted on the side.
    
    		   MAX
    	Your speech was excellent. Except, 
            I disagree with your ideas about 
            rich kids. Because, after all, we 
            don't choose who our fathers are. 
            But that's really my only criticism.
    		
    		   MR BLUME
                  (hesitates)
            Thank you.
    
    Mr Blume looks at Dirk staring up at him. Dirk says softly.
    
                       DIRK
            Hello.
    
                       MAX
            This is my chapel partner, Dirk
    	Calloway.
    
                       MR BLUME
                  (shakes Dirk's hand)
            Nice to meet you, Dirk.
    
    		   MAX
    	Thank you for coming today, sir.
    
    Max shakes Mr Blume's hand. Mr Blume smiles. But Max doesn't go.
    He just stands there. Searching for the words.
    
    		   MAX
    	I really. I think it's. You're 
            right about Rushmore. Look around. 
    	It truly is a great school.
    
    Mr Blume nods. A little uneasy.
    
    		   MAX
    	Anyway, nice to have met you.
    
    Max goes. Mr Blume and Dr Guggenheim watch him walk away with Dirk.
    
    		   MR BLUME
    	What's his name again?
    
    		   DR GUGGENHEIM
    	Max Fischer.
    
                       MR BLUME
    	He's a sharp little guy.
    
    Dr Guggenheim looks across the lawn at Max and his chapel partner.
    He says wistfully.
    
    		   DR GUGGENHEIM
    	He's one of the worst students 
            we've got.
    
    	INSERT COVER OF THE RUSHMORE YEARBOOK:
    
    It is called the Rushmore Yankee. The masthead says Max is editor-
    in-chief. There is a photograph of him laughing, surrounded by his
    staff.
    
    We cut to a series of pictures of:
    
    The French Club, Debate Team, cross-country, lacrosse, golf, drama,
    Astronomy Society, Glee Club, student council, Model United Nations,
    Stamp and Coin Club, Gun Club, Bombardment Society, calligraphy,
    fencing, kung fu, bee-keeping, and J.V. water polo.
    
    Max is president or captain of virtually every one of these.
    
    Other photographs show Max pole-vaulting, dancing at the Christmas
    Ball, and giving thumbs-up from the cockpit of a Piper Club.
    
    	    TITLE:
    
    		    September.
    
    INT. DR GUGGENHEIM'S OFFICE - DAY
    
    A paneled room with wooden floors, an old electric fan on the
    windowsill, and the paintings of ducks and geese on the walls.
    Dr Guggenheim is seated at his little oak desk. Max sits across
    from him.
    
    		   DR GUGGENHEIM
    	We're putting you on what we call
    	sudden death academic probation.
    
    		   MAX
                  (nodding)
    	And what does that mean?
    
    		   DR GUGGENHEIM
    	It entails that if you fail another 
    	class you're going to be asked to
    	leave Rushmore.
    
    		   MAX
    	I see.
                  (raises an eyebrow)
    	In order words I'll be expelled.
    
    		   DR GUGGENHEIM
    	Right.
    
    Silence.
    
    		   MAX
    	Dr Guggenheim. I don't want to tell
    	you how to do your job. But the fact
    	is no matter how hard I try I still
    	might flunk another class. And if
    	that means I have to stay on for a
    	postgraduate year, then so be it.
    	But if -
    
    		   DR GUGGENHEIM
    	We don't offer a postgraduate year.
    
    		   MAX
    	Well. We don't offer it yet.
                  (pause)
    	And what about the fact that I'm
    	probably dyslexic?
    
    		   DR GUGGENHEIM
    	You're not dyslexic.
    
    		   MAX
    	Well, I'm a terrible speller.
    		
    		   DR GUGGENHEIM
    	Just bring up the grades.
    
    Max sighs. He looks out the window and says quietly.
    
    		   MAX
    	You remember you I got into this
    	school?
    
    		   DR GUGGENHEIM
    	Yes, I do. You wrote a play.
    		   MAX
    	That's right. A little one act. About
    	Watergate. And my mother read it and 
    	felt I should go to Rushmore. And you
    	read it and you gave me a scholarship,
    	didn't you?
     
    Dr Guggenheim nods.
     
    		   MAX
    	Do you regret it?
     
    		   DR GUGGENHEIM
    	No, I don't regret it. But I still
    	might have to you expel you.
     
    Max nods. He smiles sadly and whispers:
     
    		   MAX
    	Couldn't we just let me float by?
    	For old times' sake?
     
    		   DR GUGGENHEIM
    	      (grimly)
    	Can't do it, Max.
     
    EXT. QUADRANGLE - DAY
     
    Max and Dirk comes out the door into the cold. They head across
    the grass.
     
    		   MAX
    	They want to kick me out, Dirk.
     
    		   DIRK
    	      (concerned)
    	Oh, no. Not again. What are you
    	going to do?
     
    		   MAX
    	The only thing I can do. Try to
    	pull some strings with the
    	administration, I guess.
     
    		   DIRK
    	Maybe you ought to get a tutor.
     
    		   MAX
    	I don't have time for a goddamn
    	tutor. You know my schedule.

    	      Founder: Max Fischer
     
    INT. LIBRARY - DAY
     
    A long table in the Rushmore library. Max is reading a library
    copy of a book about Jacques Cousteau. He is also playing
    backgammon with a freshman named Alex.
     
    		   ALEX
    	Did you hear they're teaching
    	Japanese next year?
     
    		   MAX
    	That's the rumor.
     
    		   ALEX
    	And they're canceling Latin.
     
    		   MAX
    	What? I tried to get Latin canceled
    	for five years. It's a dead
    	language, I'd always say.
     
    		   ALEX
    	Well, I guess they finally heard
    	you.
     
    Max shakes his head as this sinks in.
     
    		   MAX
    	At least I saved Dirk from the
    	horror.
     
    Max turns the page of his book. There is a photograph of
    Jacques Cousteau laughing uproariously. A little note is
    written in pencil in the margin next to it with an arrow
    pointing to the picture. Max frowns. He turns the book
    sideways to read it.
     
    	INSERT FRAGMENT OF NOTE IN BOOK:
    	   When one person, for whatever reason,
    	   has a chance to lead an exceptional
    	   life, he has no right to keep it to
    	   himself.
    			-Jacques Cousteau
     
    Max's frown disappears. A change comes over his face. His
    eyes glaze over dreamily. He whispers to Alex:
     
    		   MAX
    	Read this.
     
    Alex reads the quote. He looks puzzled.
     
    		   ALEX
    	What's that supposed to mean?
     
    		   MAX
    	      (mysteriously)
    	I don't know. Maybe nothing.
    	Excuse me, please.
     
    Max gets up and goes to the checkout counter. He shows the
    book to the Librarian.
     
    		   MAX
    	I'd like to see a list of all
    	the people who've checked-out
    	this book in the past year.
     
    		   LIBRARIAN
    	Why?
     
    Max points to the quote. The librarian reads it. She nods.
    She goes through the cards in a little wooden box.

    	    Miss Cross, 1st grade, room 121
     
    INT. HALLWAY - DAY
     
    Max walks down a hallway in the lower school. He is carrying
    the little scrap of paper, checking room numbers as he walks.
     
    He looks in some of the rooms. He sees kids sitting at tables
    with scissors and paste. Kids watching a movie on science.
    Kids curled-up on mats during naptime.
     
    And then he sees room 121. He goes to the door and looks
    through the window.
     
    A class of first graders are sitting Indian-style in a little
    circle on the floor. The teacher is in a tiny kid's chair,
    reading aloud from Kidnapped. She is twenty-eight. She wears a
    cardigan sweater and her hair is pulled back like a ballet
    dancer. She is Miss Cross.
     
    Max's eyes are glued to the glass. He cracks open the door an
    inch to listen to hear voice.
     
    		   MISS CROSS
    	I have seen wicked men and fools,
    	a great many of both; and I believe
    	they both get paid in the end.
    	      (darkly)
    	But the fools first.
     
    She looks up mysteriously. The turns the page and continues:

    	Silver Button'.
     
    INT. BLUME INTERNATIONAL CONCRETE - DAY
     
    Mr Blume has a gigantic office with paintings of battle scenes
    and Viking ships, a coat of armor, and a statue of a discus
    thrower. The concrete plant is outside the window.
     
    A portrait of the Blume family hangs on the wall behind Mr
    Blume's desk. His wife and twin sons are all fair-skinned
    redheads. Mr Blume is a dark and sullen. He is smoking a
    cigarette on the painting.
     
    Mr Blume sits at his desk with a silver military issue .45
    automatic disassembled in front of him. He is cleaning it
    and drinking a Bloody Mary. His Secretary buzzes him on the
    speakerphone. Mr Blume pushes a button on it.
     
    		   MR BLUME
    	Yeah?
     
    		   SECRETARY
    	Mrs Blume wants you to pick up
    	the twins from school at -

    	Tell them to take the fucking bus.
     
    INT. CAR - DAY
     
    Max is sitting in a parked Jaguar with Dirk's mother, Mrs
    Calloway. She is beautiful. She is dressed in tennis clothes
    and wears a terrycloth visor.
     
    Max is wearing a fluorescent orange crossing guard's belt
    with a badge at the shoulder that says Patrol Chief. He hands
    Mrs Calloway his phone number.
     
    		   MRS CALLOWAY
    	Thank you, Max. I was just telling
    	Mr Calloway the other day how
    	fortunate we are to have someone
    	like you looking out for Dirk.
     
    		   MAX
    	My pleasure. I'm just trying to
    	impart some of the experiences I've
    	accrued to help Dirk. There he is
    	now. Nice talking with you, Mrs
    	Calloway.
     
    They shake hands. Max gets out of the car and puts his hand
    on Dirk's shoulder.
     
    		   MAX
    	How'd the math test go?
     
    		   DIRK
    	What math test?
     
    		   MAX
    	I thought you had a math test.
     
    		   DIRK
    	No. Did you turn in your paper
    	on the Berlin Airlift?
     
    		   MAX
    	Yeah. I got an extension.
     
    Dirk gets in the car and drives off. A seventh grader named
    Bobby goes over to Max.
     
    		   BOBBY
    	How'd it go?
     
    		   MAX
    	I shook hands with her.
     
    		   BOBBY
    	Big deal.
     
    		   MAX
    	And I gave her my phone number.
     
    		   BOBBY
    	Buchan said he's already have 
    	banged her by now.
     
    		   MAX
    	He said that?
     
    Max looks across the yard at Magnus Buchan, the burly foreign-
    exchange student from Scotland. He is seventeen. He has a straw
    in his mouth, and he shoots a small blowdart at a little kid's
    neck.
     
    Half of Buchan's ear was blown off in a hunting accident.
     
    		   MAX
    	That's a really crude thing to
    	say. That's Dirk's mother.
     
    		   BOBBY
    	But I thought that's why you
    	picked Dirk as your chapel
    	partner.
     
    		   MAX
    	      (looks at Bobby, pause)
    	What are you, a lawyer? All I'm
    	saying is that gorilla is a guest
    	at our school for the year, so
    	respect our women the same way we
    	would in his jerkwater country.
     
    Mr Blume pulls up in a brand new black Bentley.
     
    		   MAX
    	Mr Blume.
     
    Max goes over to Mr Blume's car.
     
    		   MAX
    	It's Max Fischer.
     
    		   MR BLUME
    	      (weary)
    	Hi, Max.
     
    They shake hands through the open car window.
     
    		   MAX
    	How's the concrete business?
     
    		   MR BLUME
    	Oh, I don't know. By the time you
    	hit forty-five you've been fucked
    	over so many times you don't really
    	care anymore.
     
    		   MAX
    	      (frowns)
    	I'm sorry to hear that.
     
    Mr Blume sighs deeply. He stares out the windshield.
     
    		   MR BLUME
    	What's the secret, Max?
     
    		   MAX
    	The secret?
     
    		   MR BLUME
    	Yeah. You look like you've got
    	it all figured out.
     
    		   MAX
    	I don't know. I think you just got
    	to find something you love to do,
    	then do it for the rest of your
    	life.
    	      (shrugs)
    	For me, it's going to Rushmore.
     
    Max looks very serious. Mr Blume smiles and nods.
     
    		   MAX
    	Hey, Ronny. Hey, Donny.
     
    Mr Blume's red-headed twins Ronny and Donny come over to the
    car. They're Max's age but much more thick and solid.
     
    		   RONNY
    	Shotgun.
     
    Donny gets in the front seat anyway. Ronny hollers:
     
    		   RONNY
    	I said shotgun, Donny!
     
    		   MR BLUME
    	Get in the back, Ronny.
     
    Donny punches three different buttons on the dash that crank up
    the AC full blast. Mr Blume's hair dances in the cold burst of
    air. He shuts it off the AC.
     
    		   MAX
    	See you tomorrow, Mr Blume.
    	      (looks off)
    	Mrs Reynolds!
     
    Max goes to shake hands with somebody else's parents. Mr Blume
    looks after Max fondly.
     
    		   MR BLUME
    	Did you invite that kid to the
    	party?
     
    		   DONNY
    	      (shocked)
    	Max Fischer?
     
    		   RONNY
    	Come on, dad. There's going to 
    	be girls there.
     
    		   DONNY
    	Pull your head out of your ass.
     
    Mr Blume turns on Donny quickly like he is going to attack
    him. Donny cowers grinning in the backseat with his fist up.
    Ronny pipes in:
     
    		   RONNY
    	Remember what mom said. Hugs not
    	hits.
     
    INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
     
    The school auditorium. The stage is bare except for two folding
    chairs. A tall senior plays Frank. He is wearing a stocking cap
    and sunglasses. A fat kid plays Willie.
     
    		   FRANK
    	Wait a second. What time did the
    	old lady place the 911 call?
     
    		   WILLIE
    	Ten-fifteen.
     
    		   FRANK
    	      (snaps his fingers)
    	That's it.
     
    Frank jumps out of his seat.
     
    		   FRANK
    	Meet me on the corner in ten
    	minutes.
     
    		   WILLIE
    	Where're you going?
     
    		   FRANK
    	I'll tell you in the squad car.
     
    He heads toward the wings, then stops.
     
    		   FRANK
    	Oh, and, Willie. You were wrong
    	about Enrique Sanchez. He died
    	in his sleep.
     
    He exits.
     
    		   MAX
    	Excellent!
     
    Willie looks into the darkness beyond the stage. Max emerges
    and quickly climbs the steps onto the stage. He is followed
    by Dirk who is holding a script.
     
    		   MAX
    	Excellent. Irving?
     
    The stage manager is a wavy-haired sophomore named Irving. He
    comes out from backstage. Max pulls some money out his pocket
    and hands it to him.
     
    		   MAX
    	Get some root beers for anybody
    	who wants one. I don't want one.
    	OK. Next scene.
    	      (looks at Dirk's script)
    	Frank. You enter stage right with
    	the bag of cocaine.
     
    INT. BARBER'S SHOP - DAY 
     
    A small, clean barber's shop. Mr Fischer is a white-haired man of sixty-five
    in a white barber's shirt. He has just finished giving a buzzcut to a twelve
    year-old boy named Gordon.
    
                       GORDON
            May I see the back, please?
            
    Mr Fischer holds up a hand mirror so Gordon can see the back. Gordon nods.
    Max comes in rolling a Japanese ten-speed at his side.
    
    		   MR FISCHER
    	Hey, Max. How was your day?
    		
    		   MAX
    	Mh. I'd say
    	      (thinks for a second)
    	Ninety-eight percent good, two percent 
    	not so good. I need a signature on this 
    	geometry test, by the way.
    
    Max leaves his test on the counter and rolls his bike into the back room. 
    Gordon gives Mr Fischer ten dollars.
    
    		   GORDON
    	Thank you very much.
    
    Gordon goes out of the door. Mr Fischer looks at the geometry test. Max
    comes out of the back room drinking a glass of chocolate milk with a straw.
     
    		   MR FISCHER
    	Hm.
     
    		   MAX
    	I know.
     
    		   MR FISCHER
    	A 37.
     
    		   MAX
    	Pathetic. Just pathetic.
     
    		   MR FISCHER
    	Well. It could've been worse. You were 
    	right more than a third of the time.
     
    		   MAX
    	      (exploding)
    	Come on, Dad! That stinks! I can do
    	better than that!
     
    		   MR FISCHER
    	Of course, you can.
     
    		   MAX
    	For once, will you please try no to
    	look on the bright side?
     
    		   MR FISCHER
    	Sit down and let me give you a trim.
     
    Max sights deeply. He sits down. Mr Fischer signs the geometry test. He
    puts a pale-blue smock over Max and gives him a haircut.
     
    		   MAX
    	Do you think I'm stupid?
     
    		   MR FISCHER
    	No! You're just not very good at
    	math.
     
    		   MAX
    	But I'm failing English and History,
    	too.
     
    		   MR FISCHER
    	      (pause)
    	Well. Maybe you'd be better of at a
    	school where there's not so much
    	emphasis on academics.
     
    		   MAX
    	What, like barber college?
     
    Mr Fischer is stricken. Max says quietly.
     
    		   MAX
    	No. I love Rushmore. I don't want
    	to go someplace second rate. Besides,
    	it would ruin my chances of getting
    	into Oxford.
     
    EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY
    
    Miss Cross is sitting on the bleachers watching her class
    play Capture-the-Flag. She opens the book. It is 20,000
    Leagues under the Sea. She puts a cigarette in her mouth
    and searches for a lighter.
    
    A lit match appears in front of her. Max is holding it.
    He is wearing a maroon beret. Miss Cross looks at him
    curiously.
    
    		   MAX
    	Hello.
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	Hi.
    
    Miss Cross lights her cigarette from Max's match.
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	I like your hat.
    
    		   MAX
    	Thank you. You're a teacher here,
    	aren't you?
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	Uh-huh.
    
    		   MAX
    	What subject do you teach?
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	Well, I teach first grade, so I
    	do all the subjects. Except music.
    
    		   MAX
    	And this is your first year at
    	Rushmore, I take it.
    
    Miss Cross nods.
    
    		   MAX
    	I see. How long have you been a
    	smoker, if you don't mind me
    	asking?
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	Hm. Let's see. How old are you?
    
    		   MAX
    	Fifteen.
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	Since I was your age.
    
    		   MAX
    	You're kidding.
    
    Miss Cross shakes her head. Max can't believe this.
    
    		   MAX
    	You should quit.
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	You're right.
    
    		   MAX
    	      (going back to his 
    	       book)
    	And I should mind my own business.
    
    Miss Cross laughs. Max looks back up.
    
    		   MAX
    	Where'd you go to school, by the
    	way?
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	Harvard.
    
    		   MAX
    	Really? That's a coincidence. My top
    	schools where I want to apply are
    	Oxford and the Sorbonne. But my
    	safety is Harvard.
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	      (smiles)
    	That's very ambitious.
    
    		   MAX
    	Thank you.
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	What are you going to major in?
    
    		   MAX
    	Well. I haven't decided for sure.
    	But probably a double-major in
    	Mathematics and Pre-Med. What was
    	your major?
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	Latin-American studies.
    
    		   MAX
    	Ah. That's interesting. Did you hear
    	they're not going to teach Latin
    	here anymore?
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	This is more like Central America.
    
    		   MAS
    	      (pause)
    	Sure. Central America and what-not.
    	But moving on: they're going to
    	cancel Latin. They have to make
    	room for Japanese.
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	Really? That's too bad. All the
    	Romance Languages come from Latin.
    
    		   MAX
    	They do, don't they?
    	      (pause)
    	Like French, probably.
    
    She nods. She smiles.
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	Nihilo sanctum estne?
    
    		   MAX
    	That's Latin, isn't it?
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	Yeah.
    
    		   MAX
    	What does it mean?
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	Is nothing sacred?
    
    Long pause. Looking right at her.
    
    		   MAX
    	Sic transit gloria. Glory fades,
    	I'm Max Fischer.
    
    Max slides down the bench and puts out his hand.
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	Hi.
    
    They shake hands.
    
    INT. LUNCHROOM - DAY
    
    A crowd of Middle Schoolers has gathered around Max. He
    is holding a clipboard. One of the kids finishes signing
    a piece of paper on it.
    
    		   MAX
    	Good. Now you.
    	      (points to the next
    	       kid)
    	Sign here.
    
    The kid signs.
    
    	INSERT PIECE OF PAPER:
    
    A long list of signatures. Many of them are written in
    little kids' handwriting. Some are neater. Across the
    top it says PETITION. This is written in calligraphy.
    
    						CUT TO:
    
    The administration conference room. Ten teachers sit in
    chairs around a long table. Max stands before them
    finishing a speech. The petition is tacked up on the 
    wall behind him.
    
    		   MAX
    	In summation I have only one question: 
    	Is Latin dead? Nisilum sacnus?
    	      (pause, looks at his
    	       notecards)
    	estne? Only you can say. Thank you
    	for your time.
    
    Applause.
    
    	INSERT ANNOUNCEMENT:
    
    	    Thanks in part to the efforts of
    	    tenth-class member Max Fischer,
    	    Latin will now be a required
    	    course for grades 7 through
    
    INT. HALLWAY - DAY
    
    Max and a bunch of other kids are reading this 
    announcement on the bulletin board. Max is smiling
    serenely. The others are cursing and looking at Max
    with angry faces. Magnus Buchan is one of them. He
    has a strong Scottish accent.
     
    		   MAGNUS
    	Bugger off, Fischer. Ya bleedin'
    	little bollocks.
     
    		   MAX
    	Is that Latin? Not bad, Buchan.
    	Maybe you'll place out of your
    	first year.
     
    INT. GYM - DAY
    
    Mr Blume's son Ronny is in a wrestling mach. He has
    his opponent in a choke hold and is slowly strangling
    him. Mr Blume looks on distastefully from the stands.
    Max is at his side.
    
    		   MR BLUME
    	What does your dad do, Max?
    
    		   MAX
    	      (frankly)
    	He's a neurosurgeon. Over at St.
    	Joseph's. Personally, I could
    	never see myself cutting open
    	somebody's brain. But he seems
    	to enjoy it.
    
    Max shrugs. Mr Blume nods.
    
     
    		   MAX
    	You were in Vietnam, if I'm not
    	mistaken, weren't you?
    
    Mr Blume nods. Max thinks for a minute.
    
    		   MAX
    	Were you in the shit?
    
    		   MR BLUME
    	Yeah. I was in the shit.
    
    They look back out at the wrestling match. Ronny is
    crushing his opponent's face into the mat with his fist.
    Mr Blume shakes his head.
    
    		   MR BLUME
    	Tell me something, Max. What do you
    	think of Ronny and Donny?
    
    		   MAX
    	     (automatically)
    	I like them.
    
    		   MR BLUME
    	     (surprised)
    	Really?
    
    		   MAX
    	Sure.
    
    Ronny flips his opponent on the mat and flattens him with
    his body. Donny screams encouragement.
    
    		   MR BLUME
    	No. You're right. They're good kids.
    
    Max nods solemnly.
    
    		   WRESTLER
    	See you Sunday, Mr Blume.
    
    A stocky Wrestler with an ice pack on his arm walks by on
    his way to the showers. Mr Blume nods to him without
    looking up.
    
    		   MAX
    	What's Sunday?
    	
    Mr Blume looks to Max. Silence.
    
    		   MR BLUME
    	The twins are having a birthday 
    	party. And I'd love it if - 
    
    		   MAX
    	Oh, that's right. Yeah. I'm not 
    	going to be able to make it to that
    	one.
    
    Max smiles very sincerely. Silence.
    
    		   MR BLUME
    	Come work for me.
    
    		   MAX
    	     (stiffens)
    	What do you mean?
    
    		   MR BLUME
    	I mean, I could use somebody like
    	you. I could -
    
    	         MAX
    	I may not be rich, Mr Blume. And
    	my father may only be a doctor. But
    	we manage.
    
    		   MR BLUME
    	     (hesitates)
    	I didn't mean it like that. I just -
    
    		   MAX
    	No, trhank you. I mean, I appreciate
    	the offer. But I've got everything I
    	need right here at Rushmore. Besides,
    	it wouldn't be fair.
    
    		   REFEREE
    	110s!
    
    		   MAX
    	Excuse me, Mr Blume. Nice talking
    	with you.
    
    Max pulls off his blazer. He is wearing wrestling tights
    underneath. Mr Blume looks suprised.
    
    		   MR BLUME
    	You're on the team?
    
    		   MAX
    	     (shrugs)
    	I'm an alternate.
    
    Max heads out to the mat, pulling on his headgear. Mr 
    Blume calls after him:
    
    		   MR BLUME
    	What wouldn't be fair, Max?
    
    		   MAX
    	     (smiles crookedly)
    	We'd make way too much money working
    	on the same team.
    
    Mr Blume smiles faintly. He watches as Max begins his 
    math. Max is outclassed and quickly gets pinned.
    
    INT. HALLWAY - DAY
    
    Miss Cross is shepherding her class into her classroom.
    They are singing a song as they walk down the corridor.
    Across the hall a fourth-grade teacher, Mrs Guggenheim,
    comes out of her classroom. She is a handsome woman in
    her late sixties with black and silver hair.
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	Mello, Mrs Guggenheim.
    
    	         MRS GUGGENHEIM
    	Hi, Rosemary. Did you find a place?
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	Well, I'm just staying over at
    	Edward's parents' house for now.
    	They're out of town.
    
    		   MRS GUGGENEHIM
    	Oh. That's good.
    	     (pause)
    	Edward was one of my students, you
    	know.
    
    Miss Cross smiles and nods. Silence. Miss Cross points
    to a photograph in a collage on a wall.
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	I think I met that boy yesterday.
    
    Mrs Guggenheim looks at the picture.
    
    	INSERT PHOTOGRAPH:
    
    It is black and white of Max in fifth grade singing a
    show tune. His arms are opened wide and he has a top
    hat in one hand and cane in the other.
    
    		   MRS GUGGENHEIM
    	     (frowns)
    	That's Max Fischer. How'd you get
    	mixed up with him?
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	He introduced himself to me. I
    	liked him, actually.
    
    		   MRS GUGGENHEIM
    	     (resigned)
    	Yeah, I know. So do I.
    
    EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - DAY
    
    Ronny and Donny set upon a pile of birthday presents
    at a table by the pool. They are surrounded by kids
    in swimsuits.
    
    Mr Blume sits alone at the next table drinking a
    whiskey in front if the demolished birthdat cake. He 
    has a tatoo on his shoulder that says Semper Fi. 
    There is a bucket of golf balls in front of him and
    he absently tosses them into the pool one at a time.
    
    He looks over at Mrs Blume. She has red hair just
    like the twins. She is flirting with a pretty boy
    Tennis Pro. She looks back to Mr Blume coldly.
    
    Mr Blume gets up and walks around the pool. He
    pauses to shake hands with a Big Man drinking a glass
    of Scotch. The big man gives Mr Blume a sudden shove
    toward the pool, but hangs on to him so he doesn't
    fall in. The big man laughs.
    
    Mr Blume climbs up the ladder to the high dive. He
    sets down his cocktail. He slips and falls and bangs
    his knee hard on the edge of the bpard. He gets up 
    quickly. Ther is a bad cut on his knee and he is
    bleeding. He looks out at the birthday party down
    below.
    
    People begin to notice him up there.
    
    He sprints down the board, bounces once as high as he
    can, and sails out long through the air. He tucks into
    a cannon-ball. He nails the water with a huge splash.
    
    Mrs Blume gets up with a bitter look on her face and
    heads for the ladies' room.
    
    Kids gather at the edge of the pool to look down at
    Mr Blume playing dead at the bottom with golf balls all
    around him. A little boy in a Speedo underwear swims to 
    examine Mr Blume. Their eyes meet. The boy turns and 
    swims away.
    
    INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
    
    Miss Cross' classroom. The walls are lined with
    fishtanks that glow blue and make bubbling sounds.
    There are maps and pictures everywhere. A model of a
    747 hangs from the ceiling. A record player plays the
    Vienna Boys' Choir at a low volume.
    
    There is only one Kid in the room. He is taking a test. 
    Miss Cross sits at her desk grading papers.
    
    Max cracks open the door.
    
    		   MAX
    	Miss Cross?
    
    Miss Cross and the kid look back at Max. Miss Cross
    holds her finger to her lips and gets up. As she walks
    past the kid she puts her hand on the top of his head.
    She goes to Max at the door. She whispers:
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	He's taking a make-up test.
    
    		   MAX
    	These guys have tests?
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	Of course.
    
    		   MAX
    	I thought they just did coloring and
    	stuff.
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	Oh, no. They're good readers.
    
    		   MAX
    	I'm Max Fischer. We met the other
    	day.
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	I know who you are. How are you?
    
    		   MAX
    	Fine, thank you.
    
    Max just stands there.
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	You want to help me feed the fish?
    
    		   MAX
    	Yes, please.
    
    Max follows her from tank to tank as she shakes out
    fish food. They continue to whisper to each other:
    
    		   MAX
    	I thought I would just let you
    	know, as per our conversation
    	the other day -
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	Latin?
    
    		   MAX
    	Right. The Romance Languages. I gave
    	a little speech -
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	I heard about this.
    
    		   MAX
    	You did?
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	Uh-huh. I understand you made a very
    	convincing argument.
    
    		   MAX
    	I thought you'd be pleased to hear
    	they're going to continue the
    	Latin program.
    
    She looks at Max. She sets down the fish food and
    shakes his hand.
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	I'm very impressed.
    
    		   MAX
    	Thank you very much.
    
    Max picks up the can of fish food and shakes some
    into one of the acquariums.
    
    		   MAX
    	You need an assistant?
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	     (smiles)
    	Do we get to have assistants around
    	here?
    
    		   MAX
    	I doubt it. I'm on scholarship,
    	though. Academic scholarship. So
    	sometimes I get to do odd jobs.
    	     (pause)
    	How did you decide to teach at
    	Rushmore?
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	My husband went here.
    
    Max drops the can of fish food into the tank. He
    quickly fishes it out.
    
    He picks some little bits of fish food out of the
    water and throws them away. Pause.
    
    		   MAX
    	I didn't know you were married.
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	Well, he's dead now. So I'm not
    	actually married.
    
    	         MAX
    	When did he die?
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	Last year.
    
    Max nods. Silence.
    
    		   MAX
    	My mother's dead.
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.
    
    		   MAX
    	She died when I was seven.
    	     (raising an eyebrow)
    	So we both have dead people in
    	our families.
    
    They look at each other for a minute.
    
    		   MAX
    	Now what's going on in here?
    
    Max kneels down and looks into one of the fishtanks.
    There are a hundred little seahorses swimming around
    in it.
    
    		   MISS CROSS
    	Those were just born.
    
    A look of wonder comes across Max's face. He stares
    into the blue water.
    
    		   MAX
    	You really love fish, don't you?
    
    Miss Cross nods. Max puts his fingers to the glass.
    
    		   MAX
    	How much do these cost?
    
    INT. BLUME INTERNATIONAL CONCRETE - DAY
    
    Mr Blume's office. HE is talking on the telephone. Max
    sits in a chair across from him.
    
    		   MR BLUME
    	I don't want any alloys. I want
    	steel.
    	     (pause)
    	I don't give a rat's ass if he did.
    	     (pause)
    	Steel, Harry.
    
    He hangs up.
    
    		   MR BLUME
    	You change your mind? You want the
    	job?
    
    		   MAX
    	No. But I've got an idea. And need
    	some money.
    
    Mr Blume's secretary buzzes him on the speakerphone.
    
    		   SECRETARY
    	Mr Blume, they're ready for you in
    	Hyrdraulics.
    
    		   MR BLUME
    	Come with me. Let's hear your idea.
    
    INT. FACTORY - DAY
    
    Max, Mr Blume, and a big foreman named Ernie race
    across the factory in a souped-up golf cart. They're
    squeezed together with Max in the middle.
    
    		   MAX
    	Rushmore deserves an acquarium. A first
    	class acquarium where scientists can
    	lecture, and students can study marine
    	life in their natural -
    
    		   MR BLUME
    	I don't know. What do you think, Ernie?
    
    		   ERNIE
    	     (skeptical)
    	An acquarium?
    
    		   MAX
    	A hyge acquarium. An entire building.
    
    		   MR BLUME
    	What kind of fish?
    
    INT. FACTORY - DAY
    
    Mr Blume and Max, wearing hard hats, stand on a
    scaffolding overlooking a huge cat of bubbling
    conrete.
    
    		   MAX
    	     (shouting)
    	Electric eels. Barracudas. Stingrays.
    	Hammerheads. Piranhas.
    
    		   MR BLUME
    	Piranhas?
    
    		   MAX
    	That's right. Piranhas. I talked
    	to a man in South America.
    
    		   MR BLUME
    	Really. So you might have piranhas.
    
    		   MAX
    	We will have piranhas.
    
    INT. MR BLUME'S OFFICE - DAY
    
    Back in Mr Blume's office. They're seated as before.
    Max is still wearing his hard hat.
    
    		   MR BLUME
    	What does Guggenheim say?
    
    		   MAX
    	Nothing. I felt I should go to
    	you first.
    
    		   MR BLUME
    	Why?
    
    		   MAX
    	Because at this moment I feel our
    	best strategy is to keep a low
    	profile. The more preparation I can
    	do, the stronger our case will be
    	when we go to the administration.
    
    Long pause.
    
    		   MR BLUME
    	How much do you want?
    
    		   MAX
    	$35.000 for the initial plans.
    
    Max holds Mr Blume's gaze. Mr Blume picks up a pen.
    
    		   MR BLUME
    	I'll give you $2500.
    
    Max nods. Mr Blume writes out a check, tears it off,
    and hands it to Max. Max sticks it in his pocket
    like it is a five dollar bill.
    
                  RESEARCH MONTAGE:
     
                  All of the following events occur during school hours.
     
                  Max strides across the quadrangle with a determined
                  expression. He's got an armload of books on marine life.
     
                  Max watches a Jacques Cousteau film on 16mm in an empty
                  classroom. Dirk runs the projector.
     
                  Max visits a marine research facility and talks with a
                  Scientist. Max holds up a fish at the edge of a pool. A
                  killer whale jumps out of the water and takes it in its teeth.
     
                  Max flies over Rushmore in a chopper with Mr Blume. He shouts
                  out detials of the landscape and Mr Blume nods
                  enthusiastically. They are both eating sandwiches.
     
                  They set down on the soccer field. Kids come running out to
                  meet them. Max waves to them as he jumps out of the chopper.
                  He looks back to Mr Blume and gives him a thumbs-up. Mr Blume
                  smiles and waves as the chopper takes off.
     
                  Max walks with a young Architect among the trees between the
                  gym and the baseball diamond. They look at some blueprints.
                  Max pulls up third base and slides it over a few feet.
     
                  Max points to some beautiful fish in an acquarium in a pet
                  shop. The pet shop Owner reaches in with a little net.
     
                  Max pokes his head into Miss Cross's classroom. He holds up
                  two plastic baggies full of water with tropical fish swimming
                  around inside them.
     
                  Kids gather all around them as they put the new fish into the
                  acquariums. Max smiles mysteriously.
     
                                      MAX
                            You need any help grading papers
                            or anything?
     
                  INSERT BOOK REPORT:
     
                  The title is 'Young Ben Franklin'. Miss Cross writes
                  Magnificent! Keep up the good work! And draws two stars
                  across the top of the page with a red pen.
     
                  INT. MISS CROSS'S CLASSROOM - DAY
     
                  Max is staring at Miss Cross in a trange from a desk opposite
                  hers in the empty classroom. She looks up at him. He
                  continues to stare at her as if she were a statue.
     
                  Miss Cross rubs her eyes and sighs. She sets down her red
                  pen. She looks back at Max. He is still staring at her.
    
                                      MISS CROSS
                            Max?
     
                  Max looks quickly down to his papers.
     
                                      MAX
                            Uh-huh?
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            Can I ask you something?
     
                                      MAX
                            Sure.
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            Has it ever crossed your mind that
                            you're way too young for me?
     
                  Max looks up. Miss Cross smiles faintly. Silence.
     
                                      MAX
                            It's crossed by mind that you
                            might consider that a possibility,
                            yes.
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            Not to mention that you're a
                            student -
     
                                      MAX
                            And you're a teacher. And never
                            the twain shall meet. I know, I'm
                            not trying to pressure you into
                            anything, Miss Cross. I'm
                            surprised you brought it up so
                            bluntly.
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            I just want to make sure -
     
                                      MAX
                            We've become friends, haven't we?
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            Yes.
     
                                      MAX
                            Good. That's all that matters to
                            me.
     
                  Max thinks for a second, then presses on:
    
                                      MAX
                            And the truth is neither one of us
                            has the slightest idea where this
                            relationships is going. We can't
                            predict the future.
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            We don't have a relationship, Max.
     
                                      MAX
                            But we're friends.
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            Yes. And that's all we're going to
                            be.
     
                                      MAX
                            That's what I meant by
                            relationship. You want me to grab
                            a dictionary?
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            I just want to make sure we
                            understand each other.
     
                                      MAX
                            I understand. You're not attracted
                            to me. C'est la vie. I'm a big boy.
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            Max. You're fifteen. Attraction
                            doesn't enter into it.
     
                                      MAX
                            If you say so. All I'm getting at
                            is I've never met anyone like you.
                            Take that for whatever it's worth.
     
                  She thinks about this for a minute.
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            I think I can safely say I've
                            never met anyone like you, either.
     
                                      MAX
                            You haven't, have you?
     
                  Miss Cross shakes her head. Max says quietly:
     
                                      MAX
                            You want to shake hands?
    
                  She puts out her hand and they shake hands across the desk.
                  But they don't let go. They just look at each other.
     
                                      MAX
                            I'm glad we had this conversation.
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            Me too.
     
                  They finally let go of each other's hands. Miss Cross looks
                  away. She's not exactly sure what they just decided.
     
                                      MAX
                            By the way. Are you free? Thursday
                            night?
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            Free for what?
     
                                      MAX
                            Dinner.
     
                  She looks at Max strangely.
     
                                      MAX
                            We're getting a group together
                            after the play.
     
                  INSERT PLAYBILL:
     
                                      SERPICO
                             A new play by Max Fischer.
     
                  INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
     
                  A very realistic set for a New York tenement apartment.
     
                  Four men sit at a table. Three wear dark suits: O'Reilly,
                  Burnum and Fields. One has long hair, a beard, leather pants
                  and a big silver crucifix around his neck. This is Frank
                  Serpico. They are all played by high schoolers.
     
                                      FRANK
                            I can't wear a wire! They're
                            feeling me up every day!
     
                                      O'REILLY
                            Come on, Frank. You'll have
                            complete protection.
    
                                      FRANK
                                   (walking off)
                            I've heard that one before. I got
                            to go put a dime in the meter.
     
                                      BURNUM
                            Look, Officer Serpico. If you
                            agree to testify in open court -
     
                  Frank wheels around and knocks the clipboard out of
                  O'Reilly's hands. He grabs O'Reilly by both arms. Fields
                  instinctively draws his firearm.
     
                                      FRANK
                            Promise me one thing, O'Reilly.
                            You're going to follow this all
                            teh way. To the end
                                   (snaps)
                            Of the line,
                                   (snaps)
                            Where I got to be.
     
                                      O'REILLY
                                   (looking Frank right
                                    in the eye)
                            So help me, God.
     
                  The audience is deeply engrossed. A row of small kids are
                  sitting on the floor very front.
     
                  Max watches from the wings. He looks out at the audience.
     
                  He sees Mr Blume smiling proudly in the third row.
     
                  He sees Miss Cross sitting next to a big, curly-haired
                  Medical Student in surgical scrubs. She leans close to him
                  and whispers something in his ear. He smiles and nods and
                  whispers something back.
     
                  Max stares at them blankly as a shootout erupts onstage.
     
                  INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
     
                  Frank comes offstage with a bandage of his cheek and a cane
                  in his hand. Max is waiting for him backstage. Max has on a
                  headset and carries a clipboard. He is extremely keyed-up.
     
                                      MAX
                            What happened to the cannoli line?
     
                  Max follows Frank as Frank walks quietly toward the dressing
                  room.
    
                                      MAX
                            You're supposed to say, Forget
                            about it, Sanchez -
     
                                      FRANK
                                   (very angry)
                            I made a mistake, all right? It
                            didn't make any difference, anyway.
     
                                      MAX
                            Hey, I'm letting it go. But don't
                            tell me it doesn't matter. Every
                            line matters.
     
                                      FRANK
                                   (yelling)
                            Get off my back!
     
                                      MAX
                            Don't fuck with my play!
     
                  Frank turns around and punches Max in the nose. Max takes a
                  swing and misses and they wrestle as people try to break it
                  up.
     
                  INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
     
                  The whole cast is onstage bowing as the audience applauds.
                  Some of the actors motion to the wings.
     
                  Max walks out on the stage. He has a bloody Kleenex in each
                  nostril. He waves to the audience. The applause roars.
     
                  INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
     
                  The crowded dressing rooms. Actors are taking off their make-
                  up. Max is drinking a champagne cocktail and talking with his
                  father and an elderly Woman.
     
                                      WOMAN
                            I thought the acting tonight was
                            excellent.
     
                                      MAX
                            It was better in rehearsals
                                   (to his father)
                            I'll catch up with you later, Dad.
                            I've got a dinner to go to.
     
                                      MR FISCHER
                                   (interested)
                            Oh, yeah?
    
                                      MAX
                                   (pause)
                            Yeah. Cast and crew only.
     
                  Mr Fischer feels left out but tries not to show it.
     
                                      MR FISCHER
                            OK. Well, have a good time.
     
                  Miss Cross walks over to Max through the crowd. Her friend
                  the medical student follows behind her. Max's expression is
                  polite but inscrutable.
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            That was great, Max.
     
                                      MAX
                            I'm so glad you could come.
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            I want you to meet a friend of
                            mine. John Coats. Max Fischer.
     
                                      MAX
                                   (not looking at him)
                            Who's this guy?
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                                   (pause)
                            John.
     
                  Max looks at John. John smiles. Pause.
     
                                      JOHN
                            I really liked your play, man. It
                            was really cool.
     
                  Max nods. He drinks a long sip of his champagne cocktail.
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            What happened to your nose?
     
                                      MAX
                            I got punched in the face
                                   (to John)
                            What's your excuse?
     
                  Mr Blume comes over to them.
     
                                      MR BLUME
                            Am I going to get to meet your dad
                            tonight, Max?
    
                                      MAX
                            Nah. The old man's on call
                            tonight. Mr Blume, I'd like you to
                            meet Miss Cross, and I didn't
                            catch this young gentleman's name.
     
                  INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
     
                  A fancy restaurant. Max is having dinner with Mr Blume, Miss
                  Cross and John. Max is drunk.
     
                                      MAX
                            I like your nurse's uniform, guy.
     
                                      JOHN
                            These are OR scrubs.
     
                                      MAX
                                   (pause)
                            OR they?
     
                  Mr Blume laughs suddenly and whine goes up his nose. Max
                  glances to him slyly, then looks back at John.
     
                                      MAX
                            Well, they're totally
                            inappropriate for the occasion.
     
                                      JOHN
                            Well, I didn't know we were going
                            to dinner.
     
                                      MAX
                            That's because you weren't invited.
     
                                      MR BLUME
                            Take it easy, Max.
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                                   (angry)
                            You're the one who ordered him a
                            Scotch and soda.
     
                                      MAX
                            What's wrong with that? I can
                            write a hit play. Why can't I have
                            a drink when I want to unwind a
                            little? So tell me, Curly. How do
                            you know Miss Cross?
     
                                      JOHN
                            We went to Harvard together.
    
                                      MAX
                                   (shrugs)
                            And I wrote a hit play. And
                            directed it. So I'm not sweating
                            it, either.
     
                                      MR BLUME
                                   (signaling the waiter)
                            I'm going to get the check.
     
                                      MAX
                            What do you think you're doing?
     
                                      MR BLUME
                            I'm getting the -
     
                                      MAX
                            No, you're not.
     
                  The Waiter comes over. Max intercepts him:
     
                                      MAX
                            I just wanted to thank you again
                            for accommodating us. We only
                            expected to be a part of three,
                            but somebody invited himself
                            along. I apologize.
     
                                      WAITER
                            That's perfectly all right.
     
                  The waiter walks away. Miss Cross frowns.
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            You're being rude, Max.
     
                                      MAX
                            No I'm not. I'm just trying to
                            figure out why you brought this
                            gentleman to my play. And my
                            dinner, which was invitation only.
     
                  John reaches in front of Max for the butter. Max grabs his
                  spoon and swats John on the back of the hand.
     
                                      MAX
                            Would you like me to pass you the
                            butter?
     
                  Max hands John the butter.
    
                                      MISS CROSS
                            What's wrong with you?
     
                                      MAX
                                   (raising his voice)
                            What's wrong with you?
     
                  Max is making a scene. People all over the restaurant are
                  watching. Max stares at Miss Cross.
     
                                      MAX
                            You hurt my feelings. This night
                            was important to me.
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            How did I hurt your feelings?
     
                                      MAX
                            I wrote a hit play!
                                   (pause)
                            And I'm in love with you.
     
                  John looks to Miss Cross. She doesn't know what to say. Max
                  looks drunk and dejected.
     
                                      MAX
                            How do you like that, Curly?
     
                  EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY
     
                  Miss Cross and her pupils are out on the playground painting
                  pictures. Each kid has an easel.
     
                  Miss Cross sees Mr Blume standing under a tree at the edge of
                  the playground. He is wearing sunglasses and smoking a
                  cigarette. He moves slightly behind the tree. She stares at
                  him.
     
                  He waves. She waves back. He comes over.
     
                                      MR BLUME
                            Hi.
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            Were you hiding over there?
     
                  Mr Blume shrugs. He points at one of the paintings.
     
                                      MR BLUME
                            What's that?
    
                  That Artist looks up at Mr Blume. He is a small boy with jet-
                  black curly hair and piercing eyes.
     
                                      ARTIST
                                   (makes a swimming
                                    gesture)
                            It's a little swimming snake.
     
                  Mr Blume nods.
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            What can I do for you, Mr Blume?
     
                  Mr Blume turns to Miss Cross and takes off his sunglasses.
                  Silence.
     
                                      MR BLUME
                            Max wants to see you.
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            What for?
     
                                      MR BLUME
                            To apologize, I guess.
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            He send you here?
     
                                      MR BLUME
                            Yeah.
     
                  She frowns and studies Mr Blume for a minute.
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            Are you his messenger?
     
                                      MR BLUME
                            No. He's my friend.
                                   (pause)
                            You were right. I shouldn't have
                            let him drink.
     
                  Miss Cross nods. Silence.
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            I don't think I should see Max any
                            more.
     
                                      MR BLUME
                            He's not going to like the sound
                            of that.
    
                                      MISS CROSS
                            I know. But I think I let him get
                            too attached.
     
                  Mr Blume nods. Miss Cross looks uncertain.
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            Don't you think?
     
                                      MR BLUME
                                   (shrugs)
                            I don't know. You did your best.
     
                  Miss Cross smiles sadly to Mr Blume. He puts his hands in his
                  pockets.
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            Tell him I'm sorry.
     
                                      MR BLUME
                            OK.
     
                  They look at each other for a long minute. Miss Cross tucks
                  a strand of hair behind her ear. Mr Blume says quietly:
     
                                      MR BLUME
                            What's your first name?
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            Rosemary. What's yours?
     
                                      MR BLUME
                            Herman.
     
                  Silence.
     
                                      MR BLUME
                            Oh, yeah. He wrote you a letter.
     
                  He hands her a letter in a sealed envelope. She takes it.
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            Thanks.
     
                  They stand there in silence for another minute.
     
                                      MR BLUME
                            OK. So long, Rosemary.
    
                                      MISS CROSS
                                   (smiles)
                            Bye, Herman.
     
                  Mr Blume starts to go. He stops He looks back to Miss Cross.
     
                                      MR BLUME
                            Should we meet somewhere?
     
                  She hesitates.
     
                                      MR BLUME
                            To talk about Max.
     
                                      MISS CROSS
                            Yeah. I don't know.
                                   (pause)
                            Maybe.
     
                  Mr Blume nods. He turns away and walks off. She watches him
                  go. She looks at the envelope.
     
                  INSERT LETTER WRITTEN IN CALLIGRAPHY ON CRISP STATIONERY:
     
                  Max reads in voice-over.
     
                  Dear Miss Cross,
     
                      I would like to take this opportunity to formally
                  apologize for the events of the night of the twenty-third. I
                  am not accustomed to drinking alcohol. Please do me the
                  service of coming to the unveiling of a new venture I have
                  undertaken. I hope you will attend, if possible. I remain,
                  your friend,
     
                  Max Fischer.
     
                  EXT. VACANT LOT - DAY
     
                  A crowd of fifty Kids in uniforn has gathered around the
                  vacant lot beside the baseball field. Max stands with his
                  architect, smiling for the yearbook photographer. They are
                  holding a banner that says 'Cousteau-Blume Marine Observatory
                  Fundraiser'. Max has on a hard hat. There are two pick-up
                  trucks and a porta-can at the back of the vacant lot.
     
                  Max digs into the ground with a gold shovel. The shovel has
                  a ribbon around it. Flashbulbs go off. Everyone claps. Max
                  waves Dirk over.
     
                                      MAX
                            Did you see her?
    
                                      DIRK
                            She's not here.
     
                                      MAX
                            Well, see if she's in her
                            classroom.
     
                  The Contractor walks over to Max.
     
                                      CONTRACTOR
                            Should we go ahead and take care
                            of this tree?
     
                                      MAX
                            Let's wait a few minutes.
     
                  Coach Beck goes over to Max. He is six four and wears a John
                  Newcombe moustache and an Adidas warm-up. He is frowning.
     
                                      COACH BECK
                            What's going on here, Maxie?
     
                                      MAX
                            Coach Beck. Good to see you. This
                            is where they're building the new
                            acquarium. I'm in charge of the
                            committee, if you can believe it.
     
                                      COACH BECK
                            This is the baseball diamond.
     
                                      MAX
                            I believe it's being relocated a
                            few feet over.
     
                                      COACH BECK
                                   (frowns)
                            I should've been informed about
                            that.
     
                  Coach Beck walks off. Max answers some questions for the
                  School Reporters.
     
                                      REPORTER
                            Is it true the acquarium will have
                            piranhas?
     
                                      MAX
                                   (smiles)
                            Where'd you hear that?
     
                                      REPORTER
                            My source indicated that it was a
                            possibility.
    
                                      MAX
                            Yes, it's true. Excuse me, George.
     
                  Dirk has returned.
     
                                      MAX
                            What's the story?
     
                                      DIRK
                                   (a little wary)
                            She has a substitute teacher today.
     
                                      MAX
                            Why?
     
                                      DIRK
                            She probably got sick.
     
                                      MAX
                                   (looks away)
                            You know she's not sick. Give me
                            the phone.
     
                  Max dials on a cellular phone.
     
                                      MAX
                            Hi, Janet. It's Max Fischer. Is Mr
                            Blume there?
                                   (pause)
                            Well, where is he?
                                   (pause)
                            Goddammit, he's supposed to be
                            here. Let me know if you find him,
                            please.
     
                  Max hangs up. He looks off and says in a steely voice:
     
                                      MAX
                            I'm going anyway.
     
                  Max goes over to the contractor.
     
                                      MAX
                            Chop it down, Mr Chandler! We've
                            got an acquarium to build.
     
                  Max talks to another reporter.
    
                                      MAX
                            I don't give a shit about
                            barracudas. But fuck it. I'm
                            building it anyway.
     
                  The sound of power saws fills the air as Dr Guggenheim
                  appears at the edge of the lot with Coach Beck and a Security
                  Guard with a walkie-talkie. Dr Guggenheim screams:
     
                                      DR GUGGENHEIM
                            Max!
     
                  Dr Guggenheim sees the chopped-down trees and mangles
                  baseball field as he strides on to the lot.
     
                                      MAX
                            Nice to see you, Dr Gugg-
     
                                      DR GUGGENHEIM
                            Max!
                                   (seizing Max by the
                                    arm)
                            What do you think you're doing?
     
                                      MAX
                                   (pause)
                            We're having a fundraiser for-
     
                                      DR GUGGENHEIM
                            Shut those damn things off!
     
                  They turn off the power saws.
     
                                      DR GUGGENHEIM
                            Tell me this isn't happening.
     
                                      MAX
                            Dr Guggenheim, I'd rather not have
                            this conversation in front of the
                            crew.
     
                  EXT. QUADRANGLE - DAY
     
                  Dirk waits nervously on the steps in front of Dr Guggenheim's
                  office. He holds a hamster in his hands.
     
                  He gets up and goes to the windows. He looks inside.
     
                  Max is sitting in a little chair in the middle of the room
                  with his hard hat on. Dr Guggenheim and several other faculty
                  members sit around him. Dr Guggenheim is screaming at him
                  across his desk. Max is crying.
    
                  Dirk looks scared.
     
                  INT. HALLWAY - DAY
     
                  Max kneels on the floor in the hallway, emptying out his
                  locker. Papers and trash are scattered all around him. There
                  is a trashcan beside him. He is throwing away his books, one
                  at a time.
     
                  Mr Blume opens the door at the end of the hallway. Max looks
                  up at him. Silence. Max looks up back to his locker and
                  starts throwing his books in the trash again.
     
                  Mr Blume walks over to Max. He looks very sad. He kneels down
                  beside Max. He starts helping him pick up the trash off the
                  floor and put it in the trashcan.

                  INT. GROVER CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
     
                  Grover Cleveland is a public high school with two thousand
                  five hundred students.
     
                  Max sits in a front row of a math classroom. He is dressed in
                  his Rushmore uniform, with coat and tie, but his clothes are
                  wrinkled and his head has been shaved like a marine's. His
                  eyes have dark circles around them. He has a little stack of
                  index cards in his hand.
     
                  The teacher, Mrs Whitney, stands at the front of the room.
                  She is about fifty with a horn-rimmed glasses and a slight
                  English accent. She has a bemused expression on her face.
     
                                      MRS WHITNEY
                            We have a new student with us
                            today. His name's Max Fischer and
                            he's actually asked to say a few
                            words to the class. Max? You want
                            to take it away?
     
                                      MAX
                                   (standing up)
                            Sure. Thanks very much. I just
                            wanted to introduce myself.
     
                  Max looks quickly at his notecards.
    
                                      MAX
                            I'm Max Fischer. I'm a former
                            student of Rushmore Academy, which
                            I recently got expelled from.
     
                  Max flips to the next notecard.
     
                                      MAX
                            This is my first time in a public
                            school. And I know you probably
                            think I was born with a silver
                            spoon in my mouth. But I'm no
                            elitist. I think you've got some
                            great facilities, and I'm really
                            looking forward to making the best
                            of it over here at Grover
                            Cleveland.
     
                  Max sighs deeply. He rubs his eyes. His Classmates have no
                  idea what to make of him. However, one Asian girl in the back
                  rown is smiling faintly. She has short-cropped hair. The
                  spine of one of her bookcovers says Margaret Yang.
     
                                      MAX
                            One footnote: I noticed you don't
                            have a fencing team. I'm going to
                            start one up. Let me know if you'd
                            like to join. Thanks.
     
                  INT. GROVER CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
     
                  The wide halls of Grover Cleveland High School are lined with
                  orange lockers. A banner stretched down the wall says 'Murder
                  the Mustangs'. A bustling throng of high schoolers rush to
                  class.
     
                  Max walks slowly, alone, down the middle of the hall. A
                  blonde cheerleader-type Girl asks him:
     
                                      GIRL
                            Why are you so dressed up?
     
                  Max looks down at his clothes. Max looks back to the girl.
     
                                      MAX
                            Are you insane?
     
                  The girl walks off. Margaret Yang catches up to Max.
     
                                      MARGARET
                            Max?
    
                                      MAX
                            Yes?
     
                                      MARGARET
                            Hi. I'm Margaret Yang. I'm in Mrs
                            Whitney's class. I just wanted to
                            tell you I liked your speech. I
                            don't think I've ever heard of
                            anyone asking to give a speech in
                            class before.
     
                                      MAX
                            How unfortunate.
     
                                      MARGARET
                            The silver spoon remark might rub
                            some people the wrong way. But I
                            think I know how you meant it.
     
                                      MAX
                            Glad to hear it. Goodbye, Miss
                            Chang.
     
                  Max ducks into the men's room. Margaret walks quietly away.
     
                  INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY
     
                  A tiny figure dressed all in white stands alone at the far
                  end of the huge gymnasium with a fencing oil. He lunges,
                  parries, thrusts.
     
                  The basketball team suddenly floods dribbling into the
                  gymnasium, throwing passes and taking free throws. Max stops
                  fencing as they take over the room. He watches them in
                  silence. He shakes his head. He walks off the court.
     
                  INT. HALLWAY - DAY
     
                  Max puts a quarter in a pay phone. He is still wearing his
                  fencing costume.
     
                                      MAX
                            Janet. Max Fischer. Is he in?
     
                  EXT. RUSHMORE - DAY
     
                  Mr Blume answers on his cellular phone as he gets out of his
                  car and walks across the lawn at Rushmore.
     
                  We intercut the two of them.
     
                                      MR BLUME
                            Hey, Max. How's it going over
                            there?
    
                                      MAX
                            Terrible. Tell me something. When
                            you talke to Miss Cross the other
                            day, did you get the feeling-
     
                  The hall monitor Mr Holstead comes down the hall toward Max.
                  He is a big, sturdy man about fifty years old. He wears a
                  striped tie and his sleeves rolled up.
     
                                      MR HOLSTEAD
                                   (loudly)
                            Do you have a telephone pass?
     
                  Max holds up his hand for Mr Holstead to wait a minute. He
                  covers his ear so he can hear Mr Blume.
     
                  Mr Blume is looking in the windows of different classrooms.
                  Kids look out at him curiously.
     
                                      MR BLUME
                            I got to tell you, Max. I don't
                            know what you see in her. I don't
                            think she's right for you.
     
                                      MAX
                            What's that supposed to mean?
     
                  Mr Blume sees Miss Cross inside teaching her class. He stares
                  at her in a glance. He whispers:
     
                                      MR BLUME
                            Well, she's not that beautiful.
                            She's not that interesting. I
                            mean, sure, there's something
                            about her. But I see you with
                            someone-
     
                                      MAX
                            Look, Mr Blume. Your comments are
                            valuable, but let's get to the
                            point. Will she see me again? Yes
                            or no?
     
                                      MR BLUME
                                   (pause)
                            No.
     
                                      MAX
                            I'm going to go see her. Hang on.
     
                  Max looks to Mr Holstead.
    
                                      MAX
                            I'm talking on the telephone.
     
                  Mr Holstead reaches over and hangs up the phone.
     
                                      MAX
                            Come on, man. That's rude.

                  Max opens a red metal door on to the empty concrete
                  courtyard. He looks left and right. He sneaks across the
                  courtyard to the bike racks, quickly unlocks his bike, and
                  rides away.
     
                  EXT. RUSHMORE - DAY
     
                  Max rides full speed through the gates on to the Rushmore
                  campus. He flips one leg off his bike and glides in toward
                  the bike racks standing on one pedal.
     
                  Max locks up his bike and walks across the lawn.
     
                                      MAGNUS
                            You better beat it, laddie.
     
                  Max looks up at Magnus Buchan sitting in a tree smoking a
                  cigarette, hacking at a branch with a pocketknife.
     
                                      MAX
                            I hope you fall out of that tree
                            and get stick in the ass, Buchan.
     
                                      MAGNUS
                            You know, I've watched you,
                            Fischer. Snowboat, always talking,
                            picking a kid like Dirk cause his
                            mother's a great piece and then
                            getting nowhere. Like everything
                            you do. Big show. No results.
     
                                      MAX
                            And what do you call getting a
                            hand job from Mrs Calloway in her
                            Jaguar?
     
                                      MAGNUS
                            A bloody lie.
    
                                      MAX
                            You think I got kicked out for
                            just the acquarium? Nah. That
                            ain't it. It was the hand job. And
                            I'll tell you another thing. It
                            was worth it. So eat your heard
                            out, mick. I got business to
                            attend to.
     
                  EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
     
                  Miss Cross comes out the door of the lower school with a
                  basket of books and papers. She stops in front of her wagon
                  and digs in her bag for the keys.
     
                                      MAX
                            I'm sorry I embarrassed you at
                            dinner.
     
                  Miss Cross turns around. Max is standing across the driveway
                  with a sad smile on his face. Silence.
