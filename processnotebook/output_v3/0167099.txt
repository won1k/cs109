        EXT. STREET - DUSK

        FRIDA and JENNIFER walk down the sidewalk together. Frida is
        mousy and frumpy. She wears glasses and has her hair tightly
        pulled back into a ponytail. She wears baggy drab clothes -- 
        has no fashion sense and wears flat "sensible" shoes. 
        Jennifer, on the other hand, is trendy, stylish and sexy. 
        She's a head-turner. Men check out Jennifer and ignore Frida.

                                  FRIDA
                       I have cramps. I can't believe I 
                       let you talk me into this.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Come on, we've been double dating 
                       since the fourth grade.

                                  FRIDA
                       Yeah even then look what happened:
                       Michael Mortenson kissed you and 
                       Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Well that's not going to happen 
                       tonight. George said Carlton's a 
                       nice guy. 

                                  FRIDA
                       Translation: a total geek. 

                                  JENNIFER
                       Anything's better than Mark.

                                  FRIDA
                       My shrink says he's not so bad.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Your shrink always gives you bad 
                       advice. He only hears what you 
                       choose to tell him. Mark's an 
                       asshole, he cheated, he borrowed 
                       money and never paid it back, he's 
                       never had a regular job.

                                  FRIDA
                       He's a very talented musician.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Every woman at some point has to 
                       date a musician. I wish you'd get 
                       rid of Mark for good. Every time 
                       you break up you see him more than 
                       when you were going out.

                                  FRIDA
                       I guess I have a weakness for him. 
                       It's those big brown Bambi eyes.

                                  JENNIFER
                       So don't look in his eyes.

        Two guys passing by on the street check out Jennifer. One of 
        them stops in front of her.

                                  GUY
                       That's the girl who should be 
                       havin' my baby.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Yeah, that's likely. 

        She rolls her eyes and walks around the gawking guy. Frida 
        and Jennifer continue walking in silence for a moment.

                                  FRIDA
                       I wonder what it's like being you. 
                       Being noticed all the time.

                                  JENNIFER
                       People notice you Frida.

        Another guy gawking at Jennifer, isn't watching where he's 
        going and bumps smack into Frida.

                                  FRIDA
                       Oh, uh, sorry.

        The guy, still not noticing Frida, keeps walking and turns 
        back around to check out Jennifer's ass.

        Jennifer and Frida turn a corner and keep walking. Both a bit 
        embarrassed, for different reasons, at what just happened. 
        They head into a bar/restaurant. Pan up to the name of the 
        restaurant. It's called "Coyote Ugly Saloon."


        INT. RESTAURANT/TABLE - NIGHT

        Jennifer sits between GEORGE and CARLTON, who both lean in, 
        hanging on her every word. They're all having steak.

                                  JENNIFER
                       So I asked the bartender what 
                       "coyote ugly" meant. It's like the 
                       "bagger" system. You know, a two-
                       bagger -- someone so ugly that you 
                       need two bags -- one bag to put on 
                       their head and another one in case 
                       it blows off. Or a three-bagger... 

                                  GEORGE
                       Two bags for them, and one bag for 
                       your head in case her two fall off. 

        Jennifer, George and Carlton laugh.

                                  JENNIFER
                       But coyote ugly... well it's so 
                       totally offensive... it's when a 
                       guy wakes up with a girl sleeping 
                       on his arm. He looks over, and 
                       she's so ugly that he chews through 
                       his own arm to get away from her.

        Carlton and George crack up. Too much.

        PULL BACK to reveal Frida, also sitting at the table, though a 
        bit apart from the other three, picking meekly at her salad. 
        Jennifer looks over and sees Frida's not having a good time.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Have you heard of that Frida?

        Frida looks up from her plate of leaves.

                                  FRIDA
                       Sorry? I guess I wasn't listening. 
                       I just have really bad PMS.

        A total mood killer. Jennifer, George and Carlton just stare 
        at Frida. Jennifer puts her fork down and clears her throat. 

                                  JENNIFER
                       Uh, Frida... sorry about the steak 
                       house. It's Carlton's favorite.

                                  CARLTON
                       How come you're a vegetarian?

                                  FRIDA
                       When I was a kid, we couldn't eat 
                       meat on Fridays. I loved Fridays 
                       because of that. Now I can't stand 
                       the thought of eating bloody flesh. 

        Jennifer, George and Carlton look down at their rare steaks. 

        Suddenly they don't look so great.


        INT. RESTAURANT/BATHROOM - NIGHT

        Jennifer and Frida are in neighboring stalls. We see only 
        their feet below the stalls and panties around their ankles. 
        Jennifer's panties are red lace; Frida's are white cotton. 

                                  FRIDA
                       He hasn't said one word to me.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Maybe he's just shy.

                                  FRIDA
                       My date always pays more attention 
                       to you than to me.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Frida, I don't mean this as a 
                       criticism, but you might not want 
                       to talk about PMS around men. 

                                  FRIDA
                       Sorry. It's just so bad lately. 
                       You're so lucky you never get PMS.

                                  JENNIFER
                       I get a little bloated sometimes.

                                  FRIDA
                       I'd kill for just a little bloated.

        We hear a toilet FLUSH.


        INT. RESTAURANT/TABLE - NIGHT

        George and Carlton are sitting at the booth, waiting for the 
        women to return from the bathroom.

                                  GEORGE
                       It all starts with them going to 
                       the bathroom together.

                                  CARLTON
                       That many women in one place -- 
                       nothing good can come from that. 

                                  GEORGE
                       Sorry about Frida. She's been 
                       friends with Jen forever.

                                  CARLTON
                       What's with her? If they're not 
                       bleeding they're PMSing. If 
                       they're not PMSing, they're warning 
                       you about the impending doom. If 
                       you're lucky, you get a sane person 
                       one week a month. Then you gotta 
                       date three or four women just to 
                       get some normalcy in your life.

        They laugh.

                                  GEORGE
                       I'm lucky Jen's not like that.

                                  CARLTON
                       I don't believe in PMS. Women made 
                       it up just so they can be bitchy.

                                  GEORGE
                       My brother has an answer to PMS. 
                       A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A 
                       man gets sperm build-up, and if his 
                       woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's 
                       gotta get it elsewhere. 

                                  CARLTON
                       Yeah and when your woman says 
                       you're an ass, say yes, I have 
                       Abundant Sperm Syndrome.

        They both laugh.


        INT. RESTAURANT/BATHROOM - NIGHT

        Jennifer and Frida are now in front of the mirror. Jennifer 
        fixes her make-up while Frida watches her. ECU of Jennifer 
        putting lipstick on in slow motion from Frida's POV. Jennifer 
        smacks her lips in a sexy way when she's done. Frida avoids 
        looking at herself in the mirror.

                                  FRIDA
                       I always say the wrong thing. I 
                       shouldn't have come.

        Frida catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror.

                                  FRIDA
                       I'm coyote ugly.

        Jennifer looks at Frida through the mirror.

                                  JENNIFER
                       How about I give you a make-over? 
                       You'll feel better about yourself. 
                       You're actually pretty, you're just 
                       not bringing it out.

                                  FRIDA
                       You're just saying that.

        Jennifer squints at Frida for a closer look. She pulls 
        Frida's hair out of the ponytail and tries to fluff it up. 
        She takes off Frida's glasses.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Do you really need these?

                                  FRIDA
                       Only to see.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Can't you get contacts?

                                  FRIDA
                       No, it grosses me out even thinking 
                       of putting something in my eye.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Try to get through dinner without 
                       them. You have beautiful eyes.

        She snaps open Frida's purse and drops the glasses inside. 
        Frida looks at herself in the mirror. We see her POV and it's 
        out of focus. 


        INT. RESTAURANT/TABLE - NIGHT

        Jennifer and Frida rejoin Carlton and George at the table. 
        From Frida's POV things look blurry. She stumbles as she sits 
        down. She squints, hoping things will come back in focus. 

                                  CARLTON
                       You two must be in sync.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Excuse me?

                                  GEORGE
                       He was saying that when women are 
                       close friends they get their 
                       periods at the same time.

                                  JENNIFER
                             (sarcastically)
                       Yeah and when we're mad at each 
                       other we're out of sync. It only 
                       works if you're on good terms.

                                  FRIDA
                       Or if there's a full moon.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.

        She elbows George in the stomach. Frida tries to take a sip 
        from her drink, but because she can't see well she knocks it 
        over. Everyone stands up and it's a huge ordeal.

                                  FRIDA
                       I'm so sorry! I'm such a clutz.

        She fishes in her purse for her glasses and puts them on as 
        Jennifer helps her wipe up the spilled drink.


        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Frida's apartment is neat and conservatively decorated. She's 
        got some film posters on the wall. 

        Frida, in a big puffy bathrobe with bearclaw slippers, lounges 
        on her sofa. Sammy, a black cat, sits on her lap purring as 
        Frida reads a script. She nibbles on a chocolate bar. From 
        the way Frida shakes her head and flips through the pages of 
        the script, we can tell it's awful.


        INT. FRIDA'S OFFICE - DAY

        Frida sits at a claustrophobic cubicle. There's a small stack 
        of screenplays sitting in front of her. Frida's on the phone.

                                  FRIDA
                       Yes, I do think it's important to 
                       tell the Mother Teresa story... but 
                       no way can I pitch that to my boss.

                                  MAN (ON PHONE)
                       Why the hell not?

                                  FRIDA
                       It won't get the ratings. He only 
                       wants "women in jeopardy" stories. 

                                  MAN (ON PHONE)
                       How about if Mother Teresa's being 
                       stalked by the Pope?

                                  FRIDA
                       Only if Jane Seymour plays Mother 
                       Teresa and Richard Chamberlain 
                       plays the Pope. It's just not for 
                       us. I'm sorry. Good luck with it.

        Frida hears the phone slam down and a dialtone. She hangs up 
        just as her boss, MR. GRANT, barges in and barks at her.

                                  MR. GRANT
                       The Nielson's?

                                  FRIDA
                       On your desk.

                                  MR. GRANT
                       Script coverage?

                                  FRIDA
                       On your desk.

                                  MR. GRANT
                       Coffee and...

                                  FRIDA
                       Your desk.

        Mr. Grant abruptly turns and heads back into his office.

                                  FRIDA
                       There was a script I wanted to talk 
                       to you about... I thought maybe...

        She gets up with a script. As she does, she spills her coffee 
        all over the desk.

                                  FRIDA
                       ... I could produce it.

        Mr. Grant ignores her and slams the door to his office. Frida 
        wipes up the spilled coffee with the script.


        INT. SHRINK'S OFFICE - DAY

        Frida's at her SHRINK's office. 

                                  FRIDA
                       I had a dream last night, that I 
                       was a doormat.

                                                            CUT TO:


        EXT. FRONT DOOR - DAY

        Frida lies on her back outside the front door of a house, like 
        a welcome mat. People walk over her. We see from her POV: 
        people stepping over her and wiping their shoes on her.



        BACK TO SHRINK'S OFFICE

        The shrink makes a note.

                                  SHRINK
                       And what do you think this means?

        Frida stares at the shrink for a second, surprised he doesn't 
        get such an obvious reference.

                                  FRIDA
                       That I'm a doormat of course.
                       The shrink makes more notes.

                                  SHRINK
                       Oh, I see... interesting theory.



        EXT. PARK - DAY

        Jennifer and Frida sit on a bench surrounded by shopping bags.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Okay, just one more stop and you'll 
                       be all set. Victoria's Secret.

                                  FRIDA
                       What do I need overpriced fancy 
                       underwear for? Shouldn't a guy 
                       have already decided that he likes 
                       me before he sees me in lingerie? 

                                  JENNIFER
                       It's not about him seeing you in 
                       it. It's how you feel. You'll 
                       feel sexy in lingerie and it'll 
                       show. It's an inner thing.

                                  FRIDA
                       I don't know.

                                  JENNIFER
                       There's a sale. It's such a nice 
                       place -- classical music, relaxing 
                       atmosphere. You deserve to pamper 
                       yourself. Come on, it can't hurt.


        INT. VICTORIA'S SECRET - DAY

        Chaos. Hardly the "relaxed atmosphere" Jennifer described. 
        Though there is indeed classical music playing.

        CUT TO an overhead shot of a huge circular bin of women's 
        underpants and another bin of bras. All different colors. 

        Various women's hands pick frantically through the bins, 
        looking for the right size and color. Sometimes hands grab at 
        the same one simultaneously. The atmosphere seems hectic.

                                  WOMAN 1
                       Give me that. You ain't a D cup. 

                                  WOMAN 2
                       If you're a D cup, I'm Pamela 
                       Anderson.

                                  WOMAN 3
                       Is that a medium? 

                                  WOMAN 1
                       Why do they have large thongs? 
                       Anyone in a large ain't gonna be 
                       wearin' no thong.

                                  FRIDA
                       Where are all the mediums?

                                  JENNIFER
                       Frida, grab that red one. 

        Jennifer's finger points to a red panty and Frida snatches it 
        and gives it to her.

                                  WOMAN 2
                       Large, small. No fucking mediums.

        More and more hands pick through the bras and panties, with 
        increasing fervor. Frida's hand grabs a pair of blue panties.

                                  FRIDA
                       Jennifer, I got a medium!

        As Frida pulls the pair of panties out of the pile, she 
        realizes an OLIVE-SKINNED WOMAN is grabbing the other end of 
        the panties. They have a bit of a tug of war over it.

                                  OLIVE WOMAN
                       That's mine!

                                  FRIDA
                       No I had it first.

        The tug of war continues. Frida and the Olive Woman both 
        refuse to let go. It looks like they're about to rip when the 
        Olive Woman's head comes into frame -- the back of her head 
        fills the frame with brunette curls. Frida screams.

                                  FRIDA
                       OUCH!



        EXT. STREET - DAY

        Frida and Jennifer walk down the sidewalk with Victoria's 
        Secret shopping bags among others.

                                  FRIDA
                       Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?

                                  JENNIFER
                       And she got the medium.

                                  FRIDA
                       Even on sale that stuff's a 
                       fortune. I worked all week to pay 
                       for a bra.

        Frida looks at her wrist, which is beginning to swell.

                                  FRIDA
                       I think she broke the skin.

                                  JENNIFER
                       What a bitch. You should see a 
                       doctor. That can be dangerous. 
                       George bit me once and I had to go 
                       to the emergency room.

                                  FRIDA
                       George bit you?

                                  JENNIFER
                       I kind of asked him to. We were, 
                       you know... he got a little carried 
                       away...

        Frida looks at Jennifer uncomfortably. Jennifer smiles to 
        herself, reminiscing.


        INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

        Frida sits, wearing a white hospital gown, on an examining 
        table. She's bored as there isn't much to look at and it's 
        cold in there -- especially in the skimpy gown. 

        She goes to a mirror and puts on chapstick. She smacks her 
        lips as Jennifer had in after putting on lipstick. 

        Suddenly the door opens and nearly hits her. Frida backs up, 
        embarrassed, as a male DOCTOR in a white coat walks in. He 
        barely looks at Frida and stares at his clipboard.

                                  DOCTOR
                       A bite... Where'd you get bitten?

                                  FRIDA
                       At Victoria's Secret.

        The doctor looks up from his clipboard, confused.

                                  FRIDA
                       There was a sale.

                                  DOCTOR
                       I mean where on your body?

                                  FRIDA
                       Oh, on my wrist.

        She holds it up for him to see. He takes a look at it.

                                  DOCTOR
                       A dog at Victoria's Secret?

                                  FRIDA
                       No, it was another woman.

        The doctor seems skeptical. He examines her wrist closer.

                                  DOCTOR
                       This doesn't look human. Did she 
                       wear dentures or... damn this is 
                       the oddest bite I've ever seen.

        The doctor makes a note on his clipboard.

                                  DOCTOR
                       How's the rest of your health?

                                  FRIDA
                       Good. Except for PMS.

        The doctor resists the temptation to roll his eyes.

                                  DOCTOR
                       PMS. What symptoms are you 
                       experiencing?

                                  FRIDA
                       It's hard to describe. I get 
                       really bloated and irritable and 
                       emotional and depressed and...

                                  DOCTOR
                       That's just part of being a woman. 
                       Diet and exercise should help. 
                       Avoid salt, sugar, starches, 
                       caffeine, alcohol...

                                  FRIDA
                       What else is there?

                                  DOCTOR
                       And keep a journal of your symptoms 
                       to make sure it's related to your 
                       period and not just in your head.

                                  FRIDA
                       It's not just in my head.

        The doctor snaps his folder shut and heads for the door.

                                  DOCTOR
                       I'll send a nurse in to clean that 
                       bite and give you a tetanus shot. 
                       And a rabies shot... just in case.


        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Frida chomps on a carrot. She presses PLAY on her answering 
        machine and picks up a framed picture of herself and MARK. 
        They're both smiling. Frida puts the picture back, face down. 

                                  FRIDA'S MOM (ON MACHINE)
                       It's mom. I ran into Herman today. 
                       I wish you'd move back home and 
                       marry him. He's got a great job at 
                       Penneys. I don't know why you're 
                       in New York with all those freaks.

        Sammy, the black cat, whizzes by with his tail puffed. 

        Frida enters the kitchen and sees the cat's dishes are empty. 
        She gets a cat food can out of the cupboard and accidentally 
        scratches herself. She notices her nails are surprisingly 
        long. She stares at them, confused, then opens the cat food.

                                  FRIDA
                       Sammy? Seafood Feast? 

        Frida sniffs the cat food as though it smells good to her. 
        She nearly eats some -- then shakes her head, realizing it was 
        a crazy thought. She stands up and sniffs around her kitchen. 

        She searches the cupboards. Then the refrigerator. It's full 
        of fruit and vegetables. The other cupboard has healthy stuff 
        as well. Frida slams the cupboard shut. Obviously not 
        finding what she's looking for. 

        A MONTAGE with jump cuts as Frida paces in circles. She clips 
        her fingernails and toenails, which are quite long and thick. 

        She goes to the refrigerator, opens the door, looks in and 
        closes the door. She does this several times as if its 
        contents will change the next time she opens it. 

        She paces faster and faster in a tighter circle. She feels 
        claustrophobic in her clothes and practically rips them off.


        INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

        Frida hurriedly shoves several chocolate bars in her basket, 
        which is filled with junk food (frozen yogurt, chocolate-
        covered pretzels, Doritos), a box of tampons, and some Midol.

        Frida senses someone watching her as she grabs a bag of 
        Hershey's kisses. She looks up and sees BRUNO, an intriguing-
        looking man. They make eye-contact and he smiles at her. 
        Frida is nervous but flattered. She heads for the cashier.



        EXT. GROCERY STORE/STREET - NIGHT

        We see Frida walking from behind. We're in the POV of someone 
        who's following her. Then CU Frida as she continues walking, 
        holding her grocery bags. She senses someone following her 
        and spins around to look. 

        She sees Bruno walking behind her. She smiles a tad and then 
        turns back around and keeps walking. She hears Bruno's pace 
        quicken and she quickens her own. 

        We see Frida from Bruno's POV as he speeds up and is gaining 
        on her. What started out as a briefly sexy moment has 
        suddenly become kind of scary. CU on Frida walking fast. We 
        hear her heart beating fast. Bruno catches up to her -- he's 
        right behind her. Frida can hear him breathing hard. 

        Frida spins around and stares at Bruno. Her normally blue 
        yes look oddly bright -- like they're orange. She swipes at 
        the Bruno's face with her fingernails and slashes him. He 
        jumps back in pain and covers his face. 

                                  BRUNO
                       Jesus Christ!

        He pulls his hand from his face to reveal large bloody 
        scratches on his cheek. He looks up at Frida, but she's gone. 


        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Frida, in her bathrobe, is downing chocolate bars rabidly. 
        Her cat, Sammy, is hiding, frightened under the bed. 


        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - MORNING

        Frida's asleep on the sofa with her bathrobe draped over her. 
        She wakes up slowly, in a daze, like she has a bad hang-over. 

        She looks around, squinting -- the light hurts her eyes. Her 
        apartment's in disarray -- furniture moved around. She sits 
        up and puts her bathrobe on, realizing it's ripped.

                                  FRIDA
                       Sammy?

        Frida gets up and notices the cat food dish is empty. She 
        opens a can of cat food. The cat's nowhere to be seen.


        INT. FRIDA'S BATHROOM - DAY

        Frida looks in the mirror. She examines her arms and legs and 
        thinks they look hairy. They look fine, but she's obsessed. 
        She has a quick flash in which they look hairier, but then 
        they're normal again. Is it all in her head? 

        Frida leans closer to the mirror and scrutinizes her face and 
        "mustache" area. She then opens the medicine cabinet and 
        finds some Neet liquid hair remover and turns on the shower.


        INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - DAY

        Frida takes a brand new bra out of her Victoria's Secret 
        shopping bag. She puts on the bra -- it's clearly too tight. 
        She adjusts the straps to no avail -- she's still bulging out. 
        She pulls on a shirt and blazer. 

        Frida grabs her coat and briefcase and leaves. As soon as she 
        shuts the door, the cat comes out and goes to its food dish.


        EXT. PARK BENCH - DAY

        Frida sits in the sunshine eating chocolate pudding like 
        there's no tomorrow as she reads a script. She wears tennis 
        shoes with her suit. She feels a little hot and unbuttons the 
        top few buttons of her blouse. 

        GREGORY, a tall, good-looking guy in a suit, stands casting 
        his shadow on her. Frida is startled for a moment. She looks 
        up at him looming over her, but he's hard to see since the sun 
        is right behind him.

                                  GREGORY
                       Didn't mean to scare ya. It's 
                       Frida, right? I'm Gregory. From 
                       accounting.

        Frida's a little uneasy about him staring at her chest. 

                                  FRIDA
                       I know.

                                  GREGORY
                       So you're Grant's secretary?

                                  FRIDA
                       I do development for TV movies. 

                                  GREGORY
                       Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a 
                       really great idea for a screenplay.

        Frida tries to avoid cringing.

                                  FRIDA
                             (slightly sarcastic)
                       You're kidding, really?

                                  GREGORY
                       No, I'm serious. How about we have 
                       dinner and I tell you about it?


        EXT. POLICE BUILDING - DAY

        Two male police detectives, PETER and LLOYD, are getting out 
        of an unmarked car.

                                  LLOYD
                       Nah, I don't wanna break up with 
                       Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.

                                  PETER
                       Man, you're livin' dangerously. 
                       Let me ask you somethin', you 
                       always have to get women drunk 
                       before they'll sleep with you?

                                  LLOYD
                       You kiddin'? They try to get ME 
                       drunk.

                                  PETER
                       You're some catch Lloyd. 

                                  LLOYD
                       Hey, you hear about the chick that 
                       came in today? Said some chick bit 
                       her at Victoria's Secret. Bitches 
                       are outta control these days.



        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

        Frida, in her ripped bathrobe, is setting up her new makeup on 
        a table. She hears a knock on the door and heads for it.

                                  FRIDA
                       Jennifer, you're early...

        She opens the door and sees MARK, the guy from the photo she'd 
        put face down. Mark is cute, but a bit of a geek. He does 
        have the nice brown eyes Frida mentioned earlier. He carries 
        a McDonald's bag and is eating a French fry.

                                  FRIDA
                       What are you doing here Mark?

        He pushes his way past her and into the apartment.

                                  MARK
                       I missed you. I wanted to see you. 

        Frida's skeptical.

                                  MARK
                       Hey what's all this stuff?

        He shoves aside some of the makeup and puts down his 
        McDonald's bag on the table. 

                                  FRIDA
                       Jennifer's giving me a makeover.

        Mark takes a burger out of the bag and unwraps it. Frida 
        sniffs at the burger.

                                  MARK
                       What, you got a date or somethin'?

                                  FRIDA
                       Since when do you care?

        Frida lustily eyes the burger. Mark sees her check it out.

                                  MARK
                       Sorry, I know you hate the sight of 
                       meat. 

        Mark looks at Frida for a moment -- for the first time really 
        since he barged in.

                                  MARK
                       You look different. I mean you 
                       look good. 

                                  FRIDA
                       You never say that.

                                  MARK
                       You do though. You look really... 
                       is that a wonderbra?

                                  FRIDA
                       No. 

        He walks closer to her. Frida backs up.

        Mark moves in closer, puts his arms around her and tries to 
        kiss her. Frida turns her head away from his kiss. She looks 
        down and sees the burger, which sits on the table behind Mark.

        ECU of the burger looking delicious like in a commercial. 

        Frida sniffs and makes a little moan -- she's completely 
        focused on the burger. Mark thinks she's moaning for him, and 
        he continues kissing her neck. As he does, Frida reaches 
        down, picks up the burger and takes a huge bite out of it.

        CLOSE ON Frida's face as we see her sheer near-orgasmic 
        enjoyment of the burger. Suddenly Mark jerks away.

                                  MARK
                       OUCH! Shit! What the fuck?

        He twists his arm to reach around to feel his back. 
        Completely ignoring Mark's pain, Frida takes a few more chomps 
        of the burger as though she hasn't eaten in days.

        Mark lifts his shirt, which is ripped. He sees in the mirror 
        that his back has huge bleeding scratches on it.

                                  MARK
                       Look what you did!

                                  FRIDA
                       Oh my god, I'm sorry!

                                  MARK
                       Shit. And you're eating my burger? 
                       You don't eat meat.

                                  FRIDA
                       I can't help it, it smells so good.

        Frida finishes the burger with an enormous bite and then runs 
        into the bathroom and gets rubbing alcohol and a cotton ball.

                                  MARK
                       Fuck you have sharp nails.

        Frida dabs his scratches with the rubbing alcohol.

                                  MARK
                       OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I 
                       going to do with my back like this?

                                  FRIDA
                       Worried about what all your 
                       girlfriends might think?

                                  MARK
                       Frida, you know you're it for me.

                                  FRIDA
                       Yeah right... You better go. 

        Frida pulls him towards the door. Mark grabs his empty burger 
        wrapper and fries.

                                  MARK
                       Hey wait, I paid three bucks for 
                       that burger. You owe me...

                                  FRIDA
                       You haven't even paid me back the 
                       thousand bucks you owe me!

                                  MARK
                       I'm working on it...

        Frida rolls her eyes. She drags him and pushes him out the 
        door. Mark's surprised by how strong Frida is.

        Frida slams the door and locks it. 


        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - LATER

        ECUs of Jennifer putting make-up on Frida. 

                                  FRIDA
                       Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean 
                       he's cute -- he probably just wants 
                       to pitch his screenplay idea.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Maybe he likes you, ever think of 
                       that? It's good for you to go out 
                       -- get your mind off Mark. 

                                  FRIDA
                       You're so lucky you have George and 
                       don't need to go on dates anymore.

                                  JENNIFER
                       What I really hated about dating 
                       was the lines guys used to get into 
                       my apartment. "Can I use your 
                       phone?" "How about a nightcap?" 
                       "I want to meet your cat." And my 
                       all-time favorite, the old standby, 
                       "I have to use your bathroom." 

                                  FRIDA
                       Maybe they have to pee.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Are you kidding? He might as well 
                       say, "Can I date rape you?"

                                  FRIDA
                       I never thought of it like that. I 
                       never know what to do on dates. Do 
                       guys still pay?

                                  JENNIFER
                       They better. Of course, trouble 
                       is, you never know what they'll 
                       expect for it. You gotta know what 
                       to order, and what you're willing 
                       to do. Like if a guy spends a 
                       fortune on you, he's gonna feel 
                       like you owe him something.

        Frida looks worried. She picks up a big hand mirror on the 
        table and looks at herself.

                                  FRIDA
                       Oh my god, I have a mustache!

        Jennifer looks closely at Frida's face.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Where?

                                  FRIDA
                       Where? Where do you think a 
                       mustache would be. Look!

                                  JENNIFER
                       I don't see anything. Maybe just a 
                       little. 

                                  FRIDA
                       Holy shit, I'm a freak.

                                  JENNIFER
                       You are not Frida, we all have a 
                       little hair there. I didn't even 
                       notice till you showed me. We can 
                       bleach that, it's no big deal.

        Jennifer brushes Frida's hair. She pauses and looks at 
        Frida's eyes.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Hey, did you get contacts?

                                  FRIDA
                             (suddenly realizing she's not 
                             wearing glasses)
                       Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got 
                       stronger from not wearing them.


        INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

        Frida sits across the table from Gregory. 

                                  GREGORY
                       You hungry?

                                  FRIDA
                       Starving.

        A waiter hands each of them a menu. 

                                  GREGORY
                       Have whatever you want. My treat. 

        They each look at menus. The entrees are listed from lighter 
        fair down to steaks. CU of each menu item and its price. 
        Frida does a double-take at her menu. 

        Instead of seeing a dollar amount, Frida reads it like this, 
        "Chef's Salad = French Kissing and Groping; Pasta Special = 
        Heavy Petting and Breast Feel; Chicken Marsala = Blow Job; 
        Steak Frites = Regular Fucking; Surf and Turf Lobster = Kinky 
        Sex till you're sore."

                                  GREGORY
                       Man I'm starving too, I think I'll 
                       go for the Surf and Turf.

                                  FRIDA
                       I'm not really hungry after all.

                                  GREGORY
                       You said you're starving. Come on, 
                       I can't stand a woman who won't 
                       eat.

        Frida hungrily eyes a steak the waiter passes by with. She 
        inhales deeply.

                                  FRIDA
                       Maybe just one little steak...


        INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT (LATER)

        CU of Frida eating. Devouring everything on her plate. Slow 
        DOLLY IN to CU of Frida as Gregory goes on about himself.

                                  GREGORY
                       My senior year, I was waiting for 
                       that letter from Harvard. I'd 
                       heard from Yale. Got in. Brown, 
                       MIT, got in. But Harvard... here's 
                       the suspense... a letter comes... 
                       And everyone knows if it's a thin 
                       envelope you don't get in, right? 
                       So I get a thin envelope and I 
                       wasn't even gonna open it. I was 
                       just gonna jump off a bridge. 
                       Cause it was Harvard or bust... 

        Frida looks up momentarily as she rips off a particularly 
        tough piece of meat. Her food is much more interesting than 
        her date. Gregory blurs a bit into the background. His voice 
        is slightly altered -- as now we're hearing his subtext.

                                  GREGORY
                       Okay let's face it, I got into 
                       Harvard cause my dad donated 
                       $50,000. I barely got a thousand 
                       on my SATs and was kicked outta 
                       prep school, but hey, that's life. 
                       I have a really small penis. Which 
                       is why I tell stories about how 
                       great I am. I'm also losing my 
                       hair and I have no interest in a 
                       relationship. I just want you to 
                       like my screenplay idea but I do 
                       expect you to fuck me later...

        The camera's still on Frida as she's eating. She looks up at 
        Gregory again momentarily as he snaps back into focus.

                                  GREGORY
                       So there I was, hanging from the 
                       edge of a bridge, when my mom said, 
                       "Son, you got into Harvard!" It 
                       took three of them to pull me back!
                       Frida keeps eating.

                                  GREGORY
                       Well, whattdaya think?

                                  FRIDA
                       That's great. Highly original.

        Frida cleans her plate with her finger and licks it. Gregory 
        stares at her. He's only half finished -- he's been busy 
        talking, and she's been busy eating. Frida eyes his half-
        eaten steak and points at it with her fork.

                                  FRIDA
                       Are you gonna finish that?


        EXT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

        Gregory is walking Frida home. She gets her keys out.

                                  FRIDA
                       I'd really feel more comfortable 
                       paying for my half of the dinner.

                                  GREGORY
                       Hey, how about a little nightcap?

        He leans against the door, blocking Frida as she tries to 
        unlock the door.

                                  FRIDA
                       I'm really tired.

                                  GREGORY
                       Come on, didn't all that steak make 
                       you thirsty?

                                  FRIDA
                       No. Really, I'm... I don't feel 
                       well. I've got terrible PMS.

                                  GREGORY
                       They say sex is great for cramps.

                                  FRIDA
                       Well I have it worse than cramps. 
                       Goodnight Gregory.

        She tries to push him aside from the door. He doesn't budge. 
        In fact he leans closer to Frida. She can feel his breath.

                                  GREGORY
                       Can I use your bathroom?

        Frida spins around.

                                  FRIDA
                       What?

                                  GREGORY
                       I really gotta pee.

                                  FRIDA
                       You should have gone at the 
                       restaurant. 

                                  GREGORY
                       I didn't have to pee then.

                                  FRIDA
                       My apartment's just such a mess.

                                  GREGORY
                       That's okay. I just have to use 
                       the bathroom and then I'll leave.

                                  FRIDA
                       Oh come on. Knock it off.

                                  GREGORY
                       Knock what off?

                                  FRIDA
                       You don't have to pee.

                                  GREGORY
                       Yes I do have to pee!

                                  FRIDA
                       You're just saying that to get into 
                       my apartment and then you're hoping 
                       that'll turn into something else.

                                  GREGORY
                       I wouldn't mind doin' something 
                       else, but I do really have to pee. 

                                  FRIDA
                       Uh huh. So pee.

                                  GREGORY
                       So pee? Here?

                                  FRIDA
                       Yeah. Whip it out. You want me to 
                       see it -- that's what this is all 
                       about, right?

        Gregory looks at her, not sure if she's serious. Then he 
        takes a step back and looks around to make sure no one's 
        watching. He then unzips his pants and pees. Frida has the 
        urge to laugh for a moment, but then she holds it back.

        An awkward moment as Gregory takes a really long time to pee. 
        He looks over at Frida once or twice, and they exchange an 
        awkward glance. Finally he's done and he zips up his pants.

        Frida and Gregory look at each other. Frida's eyes seem to 
        glow. She takes a step towards him. Gregory's taken off 
        guard as Frida grabs him and kisses him.

        FADE TO WHITE and dissolve into next scene.


        EXT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

        Dissolve down from a bright morning sky and then dolly in 
        quietly on the building.


        INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - MORNING	31

        Move in slowly on a CU of Frida sleeping. She wakes up and 
        squirms around a little. She notices a bloody handprint on 
        her pillowcase and jolts awake. She bolts up and sees blood 
        on her hand. She quickly pushes her sheets down and sees more 
        blood on her white sheets and on her legs. She sighs, 
        realizing she's gotten her period.

                                  FRIDA
                       Thank god.

        Frida looks around and squints. Her vision's blurry. She 
        grabs her glasses and puts them on. She sees Sammy curled up 
        at the foot of her bed, purring. She pets him.

                                  FRIDA
                       Even you know when PMS is over.


        EXT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

        Frida and Jennifer are each holding laundry baskets full of 
        laundry. Frida is juggling trying to lock her door while 
        balancing her basket on her leg. 

                                  FRIDA
                       It was like I woke up in a murder 
                       scene. It took me a few seconds to 
                       realize it was just my period. I 
                       must have had a bad dream. 

        Peter and Lloyd are at the end of the hallway looking at Frida 
        and Jennifer, but the women don't notice them.

                                  PETER
                       We're looking for Frida Harris.

        Frida and Jennifer turn and see Peter and Lloyd approaching. 

                                  FRIDA
                       I'm Frida Harris.

        Her eyes lock with Peter's. There's some attraction there, 
        but we don't dwell on the moment too long. LLoyd is in no way 
        subtle checking out both women.

                                  PETER
                       We're police detectives.

        Frida feels guilty. She's not sure why. Maybe just cause 
        she's Catholic.

                                  LLOYD
                       It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.

                                  FRIDA
                       Oh my god, what happened?

                                  PETER
                       He was found a few blocks away. 

                                  LLOYD
                       Torn apart. Limb from limb. A 
                       bloody gruesome mess.

        Frida looks down at her laundry and sees the bloody sheet on 
        the top. Peter and LLoyd look down and see it too.

                                  FRIDA
                       I had a little accident.

        Jennifer sees Frida is embarrassed. Both men stare at her 
        bloody sheet. Lloyd clears his throat.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Jesus Christ she got her period. 
                       Relax guys. It happens.

                                  PETER
                       Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's 
                       roommate told us you were out with 
                       him last night.

                                  FRIDA
                       Yes... I... we had dinner.

                                  LLOYD
                       Did he come home with you? Did you 
                       go to his apartment?

                                  FRIDA
                       No, it was our first date. 

                                  LLOYD
                       Looks like it was your only date. 
                       Unless you go to his funeral.

        Lloyd chuckles. Peter shoots him a look.

                                  PETER
                       When's the last time you saw him?

                                  FRIDA
                       We... he walked me home and... we 
                       said goodnight. Um, he kissed me 
                       goodnight and that was it. 

                                  LLOYD
                       A kiss? Did you have sex with him?

                                  FRIDA
                       No, I said it was our first date.

                                  JENNIFER
                       How the hell is that your business?

                                  PETER
                       We're just trying to figure out 
                       what happened.

                                  FRIDA
                       I wish I could help but last I saw 
                       Gregory was outside my front door.

                                  PETER
                       Okay, if you think of anything 
                       else, please give us a call.

        Peter tries to hand Frida a business card, but she has no 
        hands free so he puts it on her bloody sheet. Lloyd can't 
        keep his eyes off the bloody sheet. 

                                  LLOYD
                       Uh... mind if we take those sheets 
                       in for testing? You know, to rule 
                       everything out.

        Frida turns red.

                                  JENNIFER
                       You want her sheets?

                                  PETER
                       We can just take this pillowcase.

                                  LLOYD
                       We can get a warrant if you like.

                                  FRIDA
                       No, take it. 

        Peter slips on a glove and picks up the pillowcase with the 
        bloody handprint on it. He's nearly as embarrassed as Frida. 
        Their eyes lock for a moment, then they both avert their gazes.

                                  PETER
                       Sorry.


        INT. LAUNDROMAT - MORNING

        Frida and Jennifer are taking their clothes out of dryers. 

                                  FRIDA
                       He's dead? Am I bad luck or what? 

                                  JENNIFER
                       There you go, blaming yourself for 
                       everything again. 

                                  FRIDA
                       And he was ripped limb from limb?

                                  JENNIFER
                       I'm sure they were exaggerating.

                                  FRIDA
                       Why would they exaggerate?

                                  JENNIFER
                       To sound like big macho cops. He 
                       was probably just found with a 
                       knife in his back.

        Jennifer looks up at Frida, who looks overwhelmed.

                                  JENNIFER
                       So did you do it?

                                  FRIDA
                       Did I kill him? Of course not!

                                  JENNIFER
                       No, did you fuck him?

                                  FRIDA
                       No. I don't think so.

                                  JENNIFER
                       You don't think so? You either did 
                       or your didn't.

                                  FRIDA
                       I don't remember. We kissed at my 
                       door and next thing I knew I woke 
                       up with my period. Alone.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Did you get smashed or what? You 
                       have to eat if you're drinking. 
                       And not just those little salads.

                                  FRIDA
                       I ate a burger in the afternoon and 
                       a steak and a half with Gregory.

                                  JENNIFER
                       I guess you're off that vegetarian 
                       kick you've been on for ten years.

                                  FRIDA
                       I couldn't stop eating steak. I 
                       felt out of control -- like I was 
                       making up for all those years being 
                       a vegetarian. I couldn't get 
                       enough. And then Gregory walked me 
                       home... and he peed in front of me.

                                  JENNIFER
                       What? Why the hell did he do that?

                                  FRIDA
                       He was trying to get into my 
                       apartment and... I know this sounds 
                       gross but I was so turned on. I 
                       grabbed him and kissed him! 

                                  JENNIFER
                       And then?

                                  FRIDA
                       I think I went in and fell asleep. 
                       I guess Gregory walked home and got 
                       killed! I blacked out.

                                  JENNIFER
                       At least your PMS is over.

                                  FRIDA
                       And my bra finally fits again. 

        Jennifer folds some of George's boxer shorts.

                                  JENNIFER
                       I thought you were going to stop 
                       wearing your glasses.

                                  FRIDA
                       My vision got worse again. 

        Frida pulls out a pair of men's briefs from the dryer. 
        Jennifer eyes them suspiciously.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Are those Mark's?

                                  FRIDA
                       No, Mark wears boxers. They must 
                       have been in the dryer already.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Uh huh... good thing those cops 
                       didn't see that. 

        Frida picks up Peter's card.

                                  FRIDA
                       He was cute, huh? Of course 
                       whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing 
                       no make-up.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Rule one: always wear make-up.

                                  FRIDA
                       I wonder if he's married.

                                  JENNIFER
                       He wasn't wearing a ring. But you 
                       don't want to date a cop Frida. 
                       They're so blue collar.

        Frida leaves the briefs on the laundry table. She notices 
        they're ripped.


        INT. POLICE OFFICE - DAY

        Peter and Lloyd are going over some papers.

                                  LLOYD
                       I didn't trust her. All that blood 
                       on the sheets. She may look sweet, 
                       but she could be a wolf in sheep's 
                       clothing. Something's weird.

                                  PETER
                       That dude was torn limb from limb. 
                       No way a woman like that could have 
                       done it. You never seen blood on a 
                       chick's sheets from her period?

                                  LLOYD
                       Hell no, I'm not into that shit. 
                       The sight of blood makes me sick.

                                  PETER
                       Oh, so you decide to be a cop? 
                       Seriously? You don't have sex with 
                       a woman cause she's on the rag? 

                                  LLOYD
                       No man. Blood is not a turn on. 
                       You sure let that Frida off the 
                       hook. You weren't even going to 
                       take the sheets. If I didn't know 
                       better, I'd think you liked her.

                                  PETER
                       I can tell she's not a killer. You 
                       just don't like her cause you have 
                       a hang up about menstruation.

                                  LLOYD
                       Nah, man, I'm just saying, you 
                       should never date a woman who was 
                       the last one to see a guy alive.


        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

        Jennifer is giving Frida a manicure. She's filing her nails.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Your nails are so tough and pointy. 
                       What is this stuff under them? 

        Jennifer scrapes what looks like flesh from under her nails. 
        The phone rings. 

                                  FRIDA
                       Ignore it. It's probably my mom.

        The machine picks up.

                                  FRIDA (ON MACHINE)
                       Hi it's Frida. Leave a message!

        The machine beeps.

                                  MARK (ON MACHINE)
                       Frida, Frida, Frida. I get so hot 
                       thinking about yesterday. My 
                       scratches have almost healed and 
                       I'm ready for more.

        Jennifer freezes.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? 
                       When did you see him?

                                  FRIDA
                       Um, he stopped by yesterday before 
                       you came over.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Why didn't you tell me? You said 
                       you hadn't seen him for a month.

                                  FRIDA
                       I'm sorry. I didn't want you to 
                       think I was still a doormat.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Frida, I'm your friend. I'm not 
                       judging you... You didn't sleep 
                       with the creep did you?


        INT. FRIDA'S OFFICE - DAY

        Frida sits at her desk typing at her computer. A larger stack 
        of scripts sits beside her. Mr. Grant walks by and plops 
        several more on her desk. Frida's looking buried in scripts.

                                  MR. GRANT
                       Find me that "Woman in Jeopardy" 
                       story.

        He starts to pass by as usual, then stops, stares at Frida, 
        looking her up and down. He's noticed something has changed.

                                  FRIDA
                       How about a "Man in Jeopardy" 
                       story?

                                  MR. GRANT
                       Did you change your hair?

                                  FRIDA
                       A little.

        Mr. Grant nods and continues on his way. Frida gives him the 
        look of death.


        INT. SHRINK'S OFFICE - DAY

        Frida sitting at her shrink's office.

                                  FRIDA
                       I had the strangest dream -- that I 
                       was really hungry, and I was 
                       chasing someone... I think I was 
                       some sort of animal. And my sex 
                       drive... it's embarrassing but I've 
                       had these sexual dreams too.

        The shrink leans forward eagerly.

                                  SHRINK
                       Anything about bestiality?

        Frida looks back at him quizzically.

                                  FRIDA
                       What's that?


        EXT. STREET - DAY

        Peter and Lloyd are walking. Peter's reading a lab report.

                                  LLOYD
                       Frida's sheets checked out fine. 
                       It was just her own blood. From 
                       her... you know.

                                  PETER
                       I told you she was innocent. 

                                  LLOYD
                       Hey, there was a lot of blood.

                                  PETER
                       She was never a suspect Lloyd. 
                       Some animal must have done this.

                                  LLOYD
                       I checked all the zoos. No missing 
                       animals. You think a pitbull?


                                  PETER
                       Maybe. What about all those hairs 
                       they found on his body?

                                  LLOYD
                       Waiting for DNA tests. He was 
                       hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.

                                  PETER
                       Madonna's in Penthouse?

                                  LLOYD
                       Back in the '80's. You didn't see 
                       the pictures? They were from 
                       before she got famous. She was 
                       hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush. 

                                  PETER
                       Hairy women are kind of sexy. 
                       Women in their natural state. 

        Lloyd gives Peter a grossed out, horrified look.

                                  PETER
                       What?

                                  LLOYD
                       And you think I'm sick?


        INT. FRIDA'S OFFICE - DAY

        Frida sits at her desk, typing a letter. We hear a VOICE OVER 
        of what she's typing.

                                  FRIDA (V.O.)
                       Thank you for your submission of 
                       "Woman on the Tracks." Although 
                       the story of a woman being rescued 
                       by Fabio after being tied to the 
                       train tracks is indeed the kind of 
                       lame ass "Women in Jeopardy" genre 
                       that my company seeks, I cannot of 
                       sound mind pass this script on to 
                       anyone. In a nutshell: it sucks.

        Mr. Grant walks by and dumps a few scripts on Frida's desk.

                                  FRIDA
                       Wait. Mr. Grant.

        He keeps walking. Frida rises and speaks with more authority. 

                                  FRIDA
                       Mr. Grant.

        He stops in his tracks, surprised at her tone. He turns 
        around slowly. 

                                  FRIDA
                       I can't read any more crap. These 
                       women are all victims.

                                  MR. GRANT
                       Yes, that's what we're looking for.

                                  FRIDA
                       I think we should do something with 
                       strong female characters...

                                  MR. GRANT
                       I'll make a note of that. Put the 
                       coverage on my desk.

        Mr. Grant walks into his office. Frida sits down, satisfied 
        and surprised she had the nerve to speak to him like that. 


        INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

        Frida sits across from her doctor as he examines her wrist.

                                  DOCTOR
                       That bite healed up quickly. It's 
                       been about three weeks?

                                  FRIDA
                       Nearly four.

                                  DOCTOR
                       How have you been feeling?

                                  FRIDA
                       Okay, but I'm worried about the 
                       next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. 
                       I'm not myself during it. I get 
                       bloated, irritable, my breasts get 
                       huge, my nails turn into claws, my 
                       teeth get sharper and I have more 
                       facial and body hair.

                                  DOCTOR
                       Sounds all stress related. Your 
                       teeth may feel sharper if you're 
                       grinding them at night. You don't 
                       seem hairy to me. Is that all?

                                  FRIDA
                       I get crazy dreams and I black out.

                                  DOCTOR
                       Diet and exercise, that's all there 
                       is. I'm not a big proponent of the 
                       PMS craze, but there's a book my 
                       wife mentioned called "The PMS 
                       Diet," which may be helpful.

                                  FRIDA
                       Does she have PMS?

                                  DOCTOR
                       Now it's menopause. She's always 
                       hot. I gotta wear a parka around 
                       the house cause she keeps it so 
                       cold. It's always something.

        EXT. BOOKSTORE - DAY

        Peter, wearing a "University of Michigan" T-shirt, is standing 
        across the street from the bookstore. Frida walks out of the 
        bookstore with a shopping bag and heads down the sidewalk. 
        Peter follows her. 

        Frida keeps walking but senses someone's following her. She 
        turns around quickly and sees Peter duck behind a corner. She 
        thinks about this for a second and then turns around and heads 
        for him. Peter realizes he's been seen and faces the music.

                                  PETER
                       You busted me.

                                  FRIDA
                       Are you following me? 

                                  PETER
                       No... no... this is embarrassing. 
                       I was returning your pillowcase... 
                       and I saw you cross the street... 
                       and I sort of started following 
                       you. I just find you really 
                       intriguing. I don't know why.

                                  FRIDA
                       Intriguing?

        Someone walks by, walking a dog. The dog barks viciously at 
        Frida, and the dog's owner has a tough time controlling him. 
        Frida looks afraid. Peter's a little weirded out too. The 
        dog's owner finally drags the barking dog away.

                                  FRIDA
                       I gotta get going.
                       Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.

                                  PETER
                       At least let me give you this back. 
                       I washed it.

        Just as Peter hands Frida the pillowcase, Mark rides by in his 
        bike. He screeches to a halt, nearly falling off his bike. 
        Mark stares at the pillowcase.

                                  MARK
                       What's going on Frida? 

        Peter checks Mark out. Less like a cop than a jealous suitor. 
        Mark looks at Peter like he wants to kill him.

                                  FRIDA
                       Where'd you get the bike?

                                  MARK
                       I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's 
                       this, Mr. Date-Guy?

        Mark, clearly jealous, looks at Peter, then the pillowcase. 

                                  FRIDA
                       No, this is Peter. He's a cop.

        Mark suddenly seems nervous.

                                  MARK
                       Oh, hi, uh, Pete. Gotta run Frida.

        He takes off on his bike. Peter and Frida watch him ride off.

                                  PETER
                       Being a cop has such a warm effect 
                       on people.

                                  FRIDA
                       That's my ex. He's an asshole. In 
                       case you couldn't tell. I think 
                       he's been following me.

                                  PETER
                       There's a lot of that going around.

        She starts walking. Peter walks beside her.

                                  PETER
                       You wanna get some coffee?

                                  FRIDA
                       I'm trying to stay away from 
                       caffeine.

                                  PETER
                       Some decaf then? That was stupid. 
                       Obviously you said you were staying 
                       away from caffeine as a nice way of 
                       blowing me off.

                                  FRIDA
                       No. Really. I don't drink coffee 
                       anymore. I used to love it but my 
                       tastes have changed recently.

                                  PETER
                       Okay well. Maybe some other time. 
                       They continue walking together.

                                  PETER
                       So what book did you buy?

                                  FRIDA
                       Oh, it's nothing.

                                  PETER
                       No really, I love knowing what 
                       people read.

                                  FRIDA
                       It's stupid.

                                  PETER
                       I can forgive you a bestseller.

        Frida takes her book out of her bag. It says "The PMS Diet."

                                  PETER
                       My mom used to get PMS too.

                                  FRIDA
                       Used to? Did it stop finally?

                                  PETER
                       No, she died when I was twelve.

                                  FRIDA
                       I'm sorry.

                                  PETER
                       I've had time to get over it. She 
                       was killed by wolves they think.

                                  FRIDA
                       Oh my god, by wolves?

        A chill runs down Frida's spine.

                                  PETER
                       We lived in northern Minnesota. 
                       She went for a walk one night and 
                       they never found her body -- just 
                       her torn apart clothes with her 
                       blood and wolf blood on them. Then 
                       the town rounded up bunch of 
                       hunters and shot all the wolves in 
                       the area.

                                  FRIDA
                       I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure 
                       puts my problems in perspective.

                                  PETER
                       The weird thing is I've had an odd, 
                       morbid fascination with wolves ever 
                       since. 


        EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

        Frida and Peter are walking across the bridge. The sun begins 
        setting. They look like they've talked all day.

                                  FRIDA
                       I've read scripts about detectives, 
                       but never met one. Must be wild.

                                  PETER
                       Sometimes it's frustrating. Like 
                       this Gregory Jameson case. We 
                       don't even know what killed him. 
                       I'm putting together little details 
                       to see if we're missing something.

                                  FRIDA
                       Like what?

                                  PETER
                       You know how moms always tell you 
                       to wear clean underwear in case 
                       you're in an accident? Well this 
                       guy wasn't wearing any underwear.

                                  FRIDA
                       A lot of people don't wear 
                       underwear.

                                  PETER
                       Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would 
                       need briefs to keep things in line.

        Frida blushes.

                                  PETER
                       Sorry. Sometimes I'm a bit frank.

        They keep walking for a few moments.

                                  FRIDA
                       How about you? Briefs or boxers?

                                  PETER
                       Briefs.

                                  FRIDA
                       Cool. I don't get guys who wear 
                       boxers. My ex wore boxers. I 
                       never got how he could wear khakis 
                       and not have his boxers bunch up.

                                  PETER
                       Me neither. That's why I wear 
                       briefs... So why did you and... 
                       Mark break up?

                                  FRIDA
                       He's bad news. He cheated on me, 
                       he insults me. Now suddenly he 
                       gets jealous if I have a date.

        They keep walking. CU of Peter and Frida's hands as they 
        accidentally hit a few times as they walk. Peter reaches over 
        and touches her fingers. They hold hands for a moment, then 
        Frida lets go.


        EXT. NY CITY - NIGHT

        Night shots from throughout NY city. We hear Frida and 
        Peter's dialog over ominous shots.

                                  FRIDA
                       I really gotta get going.

                                  PETER
                       Thanks for the walk. Maybe we 
                       could... get a bite sometime?

                                  FRIDA
                       Yeah. Maybe.

                                  PETER
                       Goodnight.

                                  FRIDA
                       Goodnight.

        We see the moon and it's nearly full.


        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

        Jennifer and Frida, on their way in, plunk themselves down 
        with big shopping bags.

                                  FRIDA
                       I don't think I've ever actually 
                       liked anyone I've dated before. 
                       Peter even likes me without makeup.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.

                                  FRIDA
                       I don't know much about him. How 
                       do you know if a guy is decent?

                                  JENNIFER
                       Give him the tampon test.

                                  FRIDA
                       What the hell is the tampon test?

                                  JENNIFER
                       You're at his place, and you come 
                       out of the bathroom looking all shy 
                       and say, "I'm so embarrassed but 
                       could you run out and get me some 
                       tampons?" If he says no, he's too 
                       embarrassed, then you know he's a 
                       wus. If he says he's got some in 
                       the bathroom, then you know there 
                       are other women around a lot. But 
                       if he says yes and goes to get you 
                       tampons, well then he's a decent 
                       guy. Then, while he's out...

        Jennifer's voice over continues into the next scene.


        INT. PETER'S APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

        Frida is searching through Peter's desk.

                                  JENNIFER (V.0.)
                       ... you search his apartment. Look 
                       for drugs in his medicine cabinet, 
                       look for pictures of women, look 
                       for bank statements.

        Frida looks at some framed pictures, one of Peter when he was 
        a boy with his mother. Lots of pictures of Peter as a 
        teenager with wolf-looking dogs. 

        She searches some drawers and finds just normal guy stuff. 
        His police badge. His bookshelves are filled with wolf-
        related books: Virginia Wolf, Thomas Wolfe, The Three Little 
        Pigs, Little Red Riding Hood. His CD collection: Bob Seeger 
        and the Silver Bullet Band and Los Lobos.

        Suddenly she hears the front door opening. She quickly 
        straightens herself up and spins around as Peter opens the 
        door holding a bag full of tampon boxes.

                                  PETER
                       I didn't know what kind to get.

        He dumps out the bag. He got every make and model of tampon.

                                  PETER
                       So I got one of each.


        INT. PETER'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

        Frida sits at a candle-lit dining room table while Peter 
        serves her a dinner he's cooked and pours her some wine. 
        Frida notices some bullets in a glass frame on the wall.

                                  FRIDA
                       What are those?

                                  PETER
                       Silver bullets. A collectors item. 
                       These are very valuable. They were 
                       melted down from a crucifix.

                                  FRIDA
                       What are they for?

                                  PETER
                       Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. 
                       Some people collect beanie 
                       babies... I collect silver bullets.

        They both eat. Frida takes a sip of wine.


        INT. PETER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

        Frida and Peter are on the floor in front of the fireplace. 
        They have a long, slow, ongoing kiss and cling to each other 
        while they have dialog in between.

                                  PETER
                       So... did you rummage through my 
                       stuff while I was gone?

        He kisses her again. 

                                  FRIDA
                       What?

        They kiss between sentences.

                                  PETER
                       I'm a cop -- I notice everything. 
                       That drawer's ajar, that picture's 
                       been moved about an inch, the 
                       closet wasn't closed when I left...

                                  FRIDA
                       Okay, you busted me. 

        They continue to kiss. Things start getting hot and heavy. 
        Frida lies back on the ground and gently pulls Peter on top of 
        her. They kiss for a moment then Peter pulls away.

                                  FRIDA
                       What's wrong?

                                  PETER
                       Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well 
                       don't you have your period?

                                  FRIDA
                       My period? No.

        Peter's confused. 

                                  PETER
                       But... what were those tampons for?

        Frida remembers now.

                                  FRIDA
                       Oh, yes, you're right. I guess I 
                       got carried away in the moment.

        Frida straightens herself up.

                                  PETER
                       I mean we can still... whatever... 
                       Maybe I should get a towel?

                                  FRIDA
                       No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should 
                       go. I mean... I don't want our 
                       first time to be like this. 

                                  PETER
                       Frida, wait. Don't go. We can 
                       just sleep. I just want to wake up 
                       with you.

        Frida has an itch on her arm. She looks at it and in a quick 
        flash, her arm looks incredibly hairy -- then it returns to 
        normal. Frida's freaked out. She puts her arms behind her 
        back. Peter doesn't get what's wrong.

                                  FRIDA
                       I have to go. I'm not good at 
                       relationships.


        INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

        Frida wakes up. She squints instinctively and looks for her 
        glasses. Then she realizes she can see clearly and doesn't 
        need them.

        Sammy the cat immediately whizzes by hissing and ducks into 
        the other room. Frida looks insulted.

        Frida looks in the hand mirror and notices her eyes have a 
        strange glow. She opens her mouth and her lower teeth look a 
        bit like wolves' teeth. She looks back up at her eyes again 
        and blinks, doing a double take. She looks down at her teeth 
        again and now they seem normal. 

        Frida inspects her face for facial hair. She touches her 
        breasts, which feel large and painful. 


        INT. FRIDA'S KITCHEN - DAY

        Frida looks through the "The PMS Diet" book and makes a list. 
        Strange spices, odd and completely unappetizing ingredients.

        MONTAGE of Frida coming back into apartment with all the diet 
        regimen stuff -- also bottles of Neet hair remover and tough 
        nail clippers, Midol.

        Some ultra-quick cuts -- jump cuts, etc. of Frida working out, 
        trying to stick with her diet. Finally a shot of her covered 
        in chocolate like Al Pacino with cocaine in "Scarface."


        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

        Frida, still with chocolate on her face, is on the phone.

                                  FRIDA
                       I'm freaking out. I'm like an 
                       animal and totally out of control. 
                       My arms keep getting really hairy.

                                  JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
                       You have to stop being so self-
                       critical Frida.

                                  FRIDA
                       I looked like an Italian man!

        Jennifer laughs over the phone. Frida's dead serious.


        INT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM - DAY

        Jennifer, also on a cordless phone, is getting ready to go 
        out. She wears a tight dress and is putting on red lipstick. 
        George comes up behind her and kisses her neck.

                                  JENNIFER
                       How'd it go with the cop?

                                  FRIDA (ON PHONE)
                       We almost slept together... and... 
                       then the hair started and I booked. 

                                  JENNIFER
                       Frida, this hair thing is all in 
                       your head. You're using it as an 
                       excuse not to get close to anyone.

                                  FRIDA (ON PHONE)
                       It's just as well. I'm afraid of 
                       getting hurt again. Mark seemed 
                       great at first too. I don't want 
                       to get too attached to Peter and 
                       then find out he's a creep. 

                                  JENNIFER
                       Hey, Carlton's in town -- come out 
                       with the three of us. 

        George hears this, shakes his head and motions to Jennifer 
        furiously with his hands, "No, no!" Jennifer shrugs him off.

                                  FRIDA (ON PHONE)
                       Carlton hated me.

        George glares at Jennifer. She playfully blows him a kiss.


        BACK TO FRIDA'S APARTMENT

                                  JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
                       No he didn't. Come on, I don't 
                       want to be alone with those two. 
                       All they talk about is basketball 
                       and it bores the hell out of me.

                                  FRIDA
                       Okay. I guess so.

                                  JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
                       Great. George is meeting Carlton 
                       first for drinks. We can meet and 
                       go together. It'll be a blast.


        INT. PETER'S APARTMENT - DAY

        Peter's eating a TV dinner, alone. He's doing a crossword 
        puzzle. CU of the puzzle -- Peter has written the name 
        "Frida" everywhere.


        INT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT - DAY

        Jennifer finishes her make-up and George paces the room.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Come on, I've been working with 
                       Frida. Carlton won't even 
                       recognize her now. She's really 
                       coming out of her shell.

                                  GEORGE
                       She's just so... pathetic.

                                  JENNIFER
                       She's just insecure. Once you get 
                       to know her she's fabulous.

                                  GEORGE
                       She'll talk about PMS and stare at 
                       her salad.


        INT. FRIDA'S BATHROOM - DAY

        A montage as Frida spreads Neet on her body in the shower. 
        Frida getting dressed. Her breasts are so big that she can't 
        fit into her biggest bra. She improvises with some tape.


        EXT. STREET - DUSK

        A pair of high heels walk down the street. We hear a guy's 
        whistle. Pan up the sexy legs that wear them. She's wearing 
        a miniskirt and a short jacket. Finally we get to her face 
        and it's Frida! She's a knockout. Beside her walks Jennifer.

        Frida's sexier than we've seen her. Even Jennifer looks at 
        her like, "Wow." The PMS starting again makes her sexy. 

                                  FRIDA
                       I started out on that eye-of-newt 
                       diet the doctor gave me and wound 
                       up in the tub covered in chocolate.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Well whatever it was, seems to have 
                       worked cause you look great.

                                  FRIDA
                       You're just saying that.

        A couple of CUTE GUYS pass by. Jennifer looks at them, 
        expecting them to comment on her as men usually do. Instead, 
        the guys are checking out Frida.

                                  CUTE GUY
                       Hey there beautiful. 

        Frida and Jennifer keep walking.

                                  FRIDA
                       What did he say?

                                  JENNIFER
                       I think he called you beautiful.

                                  FRIDA
                       Oh my god. I've never had that 
                       before. I've had guys say they 
                       want me to suck their dicks and 
                       gross stuff but no one's ever said 
                       "Hey there beautiful."

        Jennifer's obviously a bit miffed that the comment wasn't 
        directed at her.


        INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

        CU of Frida eating rare steak. PULL BACK TO REVEAL Carlton 
        and George on each side of her, hanging on her every word as 
        they had been with Jennifer on the previous date. Jennifer 
        sits a bit off to the side feeling slightly left out. 

                                  CARLTON
                       Guess you like those Coyote Ugly 
                       steaks now, huh?

                                  FRIDA
                       Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing 
                       down. I'm just starving.

                                  CARLTON
                       Don't apologize. It's great to see 
                       a woman really enjoying her food. 
                       I hate it when I buy a woman dinner 
                       and she won't even touch it.

                                  GEORGE
                       Yeah Jen here's always dieting and 
                       eating like a bird.

        Jennifer is picking at her plate.

                                  CARLTON
                       No one I've run into knows what 
                       "coyote ugly" means.

                                  FRIDA
                       Maybe that bartender made it up. I 
                       mean I think coyotes are rather 
                       beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is 
                       really a compliment. Like someone 
                       who's conventionally "ugly" but is 
                       really beautiful.

                                  CARLTON
                       Yeah that's like a three bagger. 
                       Today a bag is also a condom, so 
                       now a three bagger can be a chick 
                       that's really hot. So hot you 
                       gotta put several condoms on to 
                       dull the senses.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Charming Carlton.

                                  FRIDA
                       It is so hot in here.

        Frida takes off her jacket which reveals her newly large 
        breasts nearly bulging out of her shirt. Everyone at the 
        table can't help but notice. 

                                  FRIDA
                       Bag means condom now? I can't keep 
                       up with the word "bag." It used to 
                       be "No, that's not my bag" -- 
                       meaning not my thing. But now "my 
                       bag" means "my fault." 

                                  JENNIFER
                       I still thought it was a purse.

                                  GEORGE
                       You forgot the verb. To bag. "I 
                       want to bag her."

                                  FRIDA
                       Yeah but does that mean fuck her or 
                       kill her? Like a body bag?

        Frida gulps down her water. Before she has a chance to ask 
        for more, Carlton and George trip over themselves getting the 
        waiter's attention.

                                  CARLTON
                       Waiter! She needs more water. 

                                  GEORGE
                       Can we get some service here?

        Jennifer takes her cigarette pack out and offers one to 
        George. He takes one as does Jennifer. She puts her 
        cigarette in her mouth and George lights his. Jennifer leans 
        over, expecting George to light her cigarette as well, but 
        he's not paying attention to her, so he blows out his match. 
        Jennifer is not amused. Frida's eyes light up at the smoke.

                                  FRIDA
                       I have to go to the bathroom.

        She bolts up, waving away the smoke. Jennifer follows her.


        INT. RESTAURANT/BATHROOM - NIGHT

        Frida and Jennifer are fixing their make-up in the mirror.

                                  JENNIFER
                       You might want to tape your nipples 
                       down next time. It's really 
                       distracting.

                                  FRIDA
                       I can't help it. My bra wouldn't 
                       even fit. I've been going to 
                       Victoria's Secret and exchanging 
                       bras for bigger ones and still I'm 
                       busting out. It's this PMS.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.

                                  FRIDA
                       No you don't, believe me.

        Frida looks at her arm.

                                  FRIDA
                       Oh my god, look. My arms are so 
                       hairy!

                                  JENNIFER
                       No they're not.

        They compare arms. 

                                  FRIDA
                       Yes they are! Look how much more 
                       hair I have than you!

                                  JENNIFER
                       It's just cause mine is finer. A 
                       little bleach'll fix that.

                                  FRIDA
                       I look like fuckin' Chewbacca.

        A shot of Frida and Jennifer's arms and we don't see much 
        difference in them.


        INT. RESTAURANT/BOOTH - NIGHT

        Carlton and George back at the table.

                                  CARLTON
                       No way is that the same chick. The 
                       other one was a dog.

                                  GEORGE
                       Jennifer gave her a make-over. 

                                  CARLTON
                       Looks like a helluva lot more than 
                       a make-over. Was there surgery 
                       involved?

        George and Carlton ponder this.


        EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

        Frida and Carlton walk through a remote area of Central Park. 

                                  CARLTON
                       Sorry I didn't recognize you 
                       earlier. You look so different.

                                  FRIDA
                       I've changed a lot lately.

        Carlton stops walking. Frida stops as well. Carlton touches 
        Frida's hair. Frida looks at him like she's tempted. She 
        sniffs, then turns away and keeps walking. Carlton walks too.
        Carlton lights a cigarette. Frida flinches. Her eyes glow.

                                  FRIDA
                       You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.

                                  CARLTON
                       Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. 
                       I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem 
                       like all the cool people smoke?

                                  FRIDA
                       No.

                                  CARLTON
                       James Dean, Humphrey Bogart... 

                                  FRIDA
                       Yul Brynner. They're all dead.

                                  CARLTON
                       Yeah but they looked cool...

        Carlton's voice trails off as he rambles on. Meanwhile Frida 
        is feeling strange symptoms. She's scratching like a dog. 
        She smells something and starts sniffing around. 

        Frida hears snippets of other conversations in various parts 
        of the park: a hold-up, a couple arguing, a couple making out.
        Frida's head is spinning and she's breathing heavily. She 
        hears Carlton again.

                                  CARLTON
                       As James Dean said, "Live fast, die 
                       young, and leave a good-looking 
                       corpse."

        ECU of Frida scratching herself with wolfian nails.

                                  FRIDA
                       What?

                                  CARLTON
                       Your lips look delicious. 

        Frida circles him slowly, staring into his eyes. He's turned 
        on and intrigued. She takes off her jacket, breathing heavily. 
        She zones in closer. Finally she's within reaching distance, 
        and Carlton grabs her waist and pulls her toward him.

                                  CARLTON
                       Wow your body's really hot.

                                  FRIDA
                       I've been working out.

                                  CARLTON
                       I mean body temperature. Do you 
                       have a fever?

                                  FRIDA
                       Never felt better.

        She pulls the cigarette out of his hand and stomps it out. 
        She grabs his face and kisses him passionately. Then she 
        pulls away violently, which sends him spinning for a second. 
        He looks up and she's vanished. All Carlton sees is darkness.

                                  CARLTON
                       Frida? Was it something I said?


        INT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        George is lifting some free weights. Jennifer's trying on a 
        wonderbra, trying to make her chest look bigger.

                                  JENNIFER
                       I wonder how Frida and Carlton are 
                       getting along?

                                  GEORGE
                       Carlton insisted on leaving with 
                       her. Maybe he got lucky.

                                  JENNIFER
                       So now being with Frida is lucky? 
                       I thought you said she was a flake.


                                  GEORGE
                       Well the flake got a lot hotter.


        EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

        Carlton is still searching in the darkness for Frida. He 
        hears a low growling from somewhere behind him.

                                  CARLTON
                       Frida? Is this some sort of game? 
                             (playfully, as if calling a 
                             dog)
                       Here Frida... Here girl....

        He turns around but sees nothing. He takes a few more steps. 

        He hears another growl -- a bit louder and seeming a bit 
        closer. Carlton turns around and seems scared by what he 
        sees. He backpedals quickly away and breaks into a jog.

        Whatever Carlton sees starts chasing him. We HEAR growling 
        and Carlton looks scared to death. He runs through the park 
        and is chased until he falls down, and we zoom in closer on 
        his terrified face as he screams. The growling gets louder. 
        Carlton's face is blocked by a shadow.


        EXT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

        A quiet and serene morning. DOLLY IN towards Frida's window. 


        INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

        Move in slowly on a CU of Frida sleeping -- same as the shot 
        earlier when she woke up with blood on her sheets. She wakes 
        up and sees a bloody handprint on her pillowcase. Frida's not 
        as alarmed, having seen this once before. She quickly pushes 
        her sheets down and sees some more blood and then quite a bit 
        more blood and... 

        A man's severed arm! Frida bolts out of bed screaming.

        Frida goes back toward the bed where the bloody arm is in the 
        center. She circles the bed, wondering what the hell to do.

                                  FRIDA
                             Holy shit, holy shit.

        She picks up the cordless phone and dials, in a panic.


        INT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM - MORNING

        CU of George smiling, leaning against the bed backboard. Pull 
        back to reveal he's sitting up on the bed naked, except for a 
        huge mound of whipped cream that covers his groin. Jennifer 
        is scantily clad and covered in whipped cream, spraying more 
        whipped cream on George's mound. They're giggling.

        The phone rings. Jennifer bends down and licks a bit of 
        whipped cream off George's mound.


        INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

        Frida, panicking and putting large boots on, hears the ringing 
        through her cordless phone.


        BACK TO JENNIFER'S APARTMENT

        The phone keeps ringing. Jennifer giggles. George sprays 
        whipped cream on Jennifer.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Let it ring.

        George reaches over to get the phone and picks it up. 
        Jennifer's disappointed that he answered.

                                  GEORGE
                       Yeah?

                                  FRIDA (ON PHONE)
                       George, I need to talk to Jennifer. 
                       It's an emergency.

        Out of frame, Jennifer must be doing something to George, 
        cause he starts moaning with pleasure.

                                  FRIDA (ON PHONE)
                       George? Is she there?

        George hands the phone to Jennifer. Her face is now covered 
        with whipped cream as though she's just had a pie in the face.

                                  GEORGE
                       It's for you. Frida.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Tell her I'm eating.

        Jennifer and George laugh. George hands the phone to Jennifer 
        and accidentally drops it in a pile of whipped cream. 


        INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

        Frida hears the muffled sounds of Jennifer and George 
        laughing. Finally she hears Jennifer, still half-laughing.

                                  JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
                       Frida, this is a bad time. We're 
                       having sex and George actually 
                       answered the phone. 

                                  FRIDA
                       There is a man's arm in my bed.


        BACK TO JENNIFER'S APARTMENT

                                  JENNIFER
                       Frida, you are not coyote ugly. 
                       Everyone was drooling over you last 
                       night. Including George. 

        Jennifer flicks some whipped cream in George's face. He 
        tickles Jennifer, and she nearly drops the phone.


        BACK TO FRIDA'S BEDROOM

        Frida circles the bed again.

                                  FRIDA
                       Jennifer. A severed arm. It's 
                       bloody and... I'm not sure but it 
                       may be Carlton's. 

                                  JENNIFER
                       You fucked Carlton? See I told you 
                       he liked you.

                                  FRIDA
                       No! Not fucked him, I think I 
                       killed him.


        BACK TO JENNIFER'S BEDROOM

        Jennifer is laughing. George spreads her legs and sprays some 
        whipped cream on her. From Jennifer's POV -- we see George's 
        upper half as he holds her leg up to the side of frame.

                                  FRIDA (ON PHONE)
                       Please come over. I'm begging you. 
                       What should I do with the arm? 
                       Should I call the cops or... Peter?

                                  JENNIFER
                       Frida, you're not making sense. I 
                       can't come over right now. 

        Jennifer hangs up the phone and looks at George.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Frida's hallucinating. Her PMS is 
                       out of control.


        BACK TO FRIDA'S BEDROOM

        Frida runs in wearing rubber gloves and holding a trash bag 
        and a broom. 

        She pokes the arm with the end of the broomstick. 

        Frida wraps the arm in a sheet -- careful to not touch it and 
        obviously grossed out. She opens the trash bag and spreads it 
        out on the floor. With the broom, she pushes the sheet-
        wrapped arm into the trash bag.

        MONTAGE of Frida darting around the apartment, searching for 
        places to stick the severed arm.


        INT. FRIDA'S KITCHEN - DAY

        Frida has the arm in her sink and is trying to fit it down the 
        garbage disposal. The phone rings. The arm is standing 
        straight up in her sink -- half shoved down the drain -- 
        fingers side up. Frida runs to get the cordless and brings it 
        into the kitchen. She's a bit breathless when she answers.

                                  FRIDA
                       Jennifer?

                                  MOTHER (ON PHONE)
                       No it's mom.

                                  FRIDA
                       Mom!

        Frida recoils from the arm and the sink. Feeling somehow more 
        guilty about it with her mom on the phone.

                                  MOTHER (ON PHONE)
                       We're worried about you. "60 
                       Minutes" was on same-sex couples.

                                  FRIDA
                       What does that have to do with me?

                                  MOTHER (ON PHONE)
                       You haven't mentioned dating anyone 
                       since Mark and, well you're not a 
                       lesbian are you?

                                  FRIDA
                       No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.

                                  MOTHER (ON PHONE)
                       It's okay if you are, we just want 
                       to know. I don't want to be 
                       expecting grandchildren if...

        Frida glances at the arm in her sink.

                                  FRIDA
                       I gotta go. My sink is clogged.

        Frida hangs up. She inches over to the sink and turns on the 
        garbage disposal. It makes a horrid noise and blood spurts 
        about, but the arm slowly makes its way down the drain.


        INT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY

        Frida is alone in the laundromat. She shoves the bloody 
        sheets in the washer. Behind her, Peter walks in.

                                  PETER
                       Frida?

        Frida quickly slams shut the washer and spins around, 
        startled. She turns red and looks guilty.

                                  FRIDA
                       Oh my god, you scared the shit out 
                       of me. You following me again?

                                  PETER
                             (hurt by her accusation)
                       No. I was doing my laundry.

                                  FRIDA
                       I'm sorry -- I'm on edge today. 

        Peter goes to one of the dryers and takes out his clothes.

                                  PETER
                       Shit, where's my Michigan shirt?

        He sticks his head in the dryer looking for it.

                                  PETER
                       Was there anything in that washer?

                                  FRIDA
                       No. Nope, nothing in it.

        Frida backs up and puts her hand on top of the washer, 
        protecting it.

                                  PETER
                       You sure? It's my favorite shirt, 
                       mind if I check?

                                  FRIDA
                       NO! I... I checked when I put my 
                       stuff in. I always look through 
                       the washer first. 

        Peter backs up, noticing Frida's acting weird. He's a little 
        hurt by her distance.

                                  PETER
                       Oh... okay well maybe I lost it 
                       somewhere... 

        He goes to his laundry bag. Trying to think of what to say.

                                  PETER
                       Hey, I'm sorry if things got a 
                       little heavy the other...

        His beeper rings. He takes a cellular phone out of his pocket 
        and dials.

                                  PETER
                       Yeah? Uh huh... What? Torn to 
                       bits? Jesus Christ. Okay I'll be 
                       right there.

        He puts the cellular phone back in his pocket.

                                  FRIDA
                       Everything okay?

                                  PETER
                       A man killed in Central Park. 

        Peter runs out. Frida paces nervously around the laundromat.


        INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - DAY

        Jennifer looks at Frida incredulously.

                                  JENNIFER
                             (sarcastically)
                       So where's this infamous arm now?

                                  FRIDA
                       I put it down the garbage disposal.

                                  JENNIFER
                       And what makes you think you killed 
                       a man?

                                  FRIDA
                       Because of PMS, I get hairy, my 
                       nails turn into claws, I eat raw 
                       meat, I roam the city hunting for 
                       flesh. I've become a werewolf!

        Jennifer stares at Frida.

                                  JENNIFER
                       You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. 
                       Frida, are you on drugs?

                                  FRIDA
                       No, last night I think I chased 
                       Carlton around as a wolf and killed 
                       him. I woke up with a taste of 
                       blood in my mouth and a severed arm 
                       in my bed. And my throat hurts.

        Jennifer sits down. She shakes her head.

                                  JENNIFER
                       You're delusional. Maybe you had a 
                       bad dream and bit your lip -- so 
                       you tasted blood. And the severed 
                       arm... well I don't see it and... 
                       maybe this is all in your head.

                                  FRIDA
                       It took me an hour to clean it up. 
                       That was not in my head!

                                  JENNIFER
                       Maybe the blood was from your 
                       period like before.

                                  FRIDA
                       I haven't gotten it yet.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Frida, listen to yourself. If I 
                       said I was a werewolf, would you 
                       believe me?

                                  FRIDA
                       I don't know. You have to take 
                       Sammy. He's afraid of me.


        INT. SHRINK'S OFFICE - DAY

        Frida sits in her shrink's office.

                                  FRIDA
                       I think I'm a werewolf.

                                  SHRINK
                       Let's explore this. What makes you 
                       feel you're a werewolf?

        The shrink makes notes on his pad, "Insane. Delusional."

                                  FRIDA
                       I ate a guy last night.

                                  SHRINK
                       And how did you feel when you ate 
                       this guy?

                                  FRIDA
                       I don't know. I don't remember 
                       doing it.

        The shrink sits back in his chair. He thinks for a moment 
        while Frida stares at him. Finally he nods knowingly.

                                  SHRINK
                       Dreams about killing usually 
                       signify feelings of guilt. You had 
                       sex last night and you feel guilty.

                                  FRIDA
                       We didn't have sex. 

                                  SHRINK
                       You say you killed a man and don't 
                       remember it. Couldn't you have had 
                       sex and not remember it? It's 
                       sexual. Why did you choose "eating 
                       him" as the method of killing? 

                                  FRIDA
                       Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!

                                  SHRINK
                       You use the word "fucking." You're 
                       sexualizing things. Stop berating 
                       yourself. It's okay to have sex. 


        INT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT - DAY

        Jennifer stands near the door with the cat carrying case. 
        George opens a window at the other side of the room.

                                  GEORGE
                       I'm supposed to put up with a 
                       fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause 
                       your friend's got PMS?

                                  JENNIFER
                       It's so bad she becomes a werewolf. 

                                  GEORGE
                       You have some weird friends. What 
                       does her thinking she's a werewolf 
                       have to do with us having the cat?

                                  JENNIFER
                       Don't be stupid George. Obviously 
                       if she's a werewolf, she can't be 
                       around a cat. She might eat it and 
                       besides, cats are afraid of wolves.

        George sneezes.

                                  GEORGE
                       Oh great. What the fuck am I 
                       supposed to do?

                                  JENNIFER
                       Take some allergy medicine.

                                  GEORGE
                       You can't believe this bullshit. 

                                  JENNIFER
                       She's my best friend. I gotta be 
                       there for her -- no matter how 
                       crazy it sounds. I've been in some 
                       bad relationships and she's been 
                       there for me. She's lonely. If 
                       pretending she's a werewolf helps, 
                       then more power to her. 

        She hears another "meow" from the carrier.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Do we have any tuna?


        INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - DUSK

        Frida, very tired, goes to sleep.


        INT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT - DUSK

        George takes his allergy medicine. Jennifer is opening a can 
        of cat food. The doorbell rings. George goes to answer it in 
        the background as Jennifer feeds the cat in the foreground. 
        George opens the door -- Peter and Lloyd stand there.

                                  PETER
                       Are you George McCracken?

        Jennifer looks over.

                                  JENNIFER
                       They're police detectives.

        George nods. Jennifer starts opening the cat food can.

                                  GEORGE
                       Yeah, I'm George McCracken.

                                  PETER
                       We're here about Carlton Fraser. 

        Jennifer freezes. 

                                  LLOYD
                       Your address was in his pocket.

                                  GEORGE
                       Yeah, we were out last night. What 
                       happened? Was he in an accident?

                                  PETER
                       He was found nearly ripped to 
                       shreds in Central Park.

                                  LLOYD
                       And he was missing an arm.

        Jennifer drops the can opener. Peter looks over. Jennifer 
        picks up the can opener and puts it on the counter.

                                  PETER
                       When's the last time you saw 
                       Carlton?

                                  GEORGE
                       After dinner, he left with Jen's 
                       friend, Frida.

        Peter looks at Jennifer, who looks like she's seen a ghost. 

                                  PETER
                       Frida Harris? Was she dating him?

        Peter seems jealous. Lloyd looks suspicious.

                                  JENNIFER
                       No, heavens no. They're just... 
                       friends. 

        Lloyd looks at Peter. Peter changes the subject quickly.

                                  PETER
                       Uh... do you know any enemies 
                       Carlton might have?

        Jennifer and George look at each other, shake their heads, "no."


        INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

        Frida is sleeping. Suddenly she rolls over and opens her 
        eyes. Her eyes have an orangish glow. She's wide awake but 
        looks trance-like.

        Fade to Black.


        INT. SPENCER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        OVER DARKNESS, we hear the giggling of Frida and SPENCER.

                                  SPENCER
                       Is Frida your real name or just 
                       what you tell guys you meet at 
                       clubs?

                                  FRIDA
                       It's Frida. Frida the FREAK.

        Spencer and Frida laugh. We hear the rattle of keys.

                                  FRIDA
                       Having trouble sticking it in?

        As the apartment door opens, we see (in silhouette) Spencer 
        carrying Frida over the threshold as a groom would his bride. 
        He then flips on the lights of his apartment and kicks the 
        door closed behind him. Spencer is longhaired and sexy. 

        Frida is dressed very seductively and wears a lot of makeup -- 
        but she looks great. She's busty and curvy -- barely 
        recognizable from the frump of the first few scenes. Frida 
        holds her hand up to block the light from her eyes.

                                  FRIDA
                       The lights bother my eyes. Can we 
                       turn them off?
                                  SPENCER
                       But you're so beautiful. I want to 
                       look at you.

        Frida takes a big whiff of Spencer.

                                  FRIDA
                       Ummmm... you smell good.

        Spencer puts Frida down. She immediately starts pacing and 
        circling the apartment, wolflike. She's on the prowl. She's 
        acting different than we've seen her before. Spencer is 
        wearing a Los Lobos T-shirt.

                                  FRIDA
                       Are all these your guitars?

                                  SPENCER
                       Are those your real breasts?

        She struts over to him.

                                  FRIDA
                       Why don't you decide for yourself.

        Frida puts his hands on her breasts and gives him a deep, 
        aggressive kiss. She unzips his pants.

                                  FRIDA
                       You're not too drunk, are you?


        INT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Jennifer is on her cellular phone. She's hunched behind a 
        closed door like she doesn't want to be seen or heard.
        She hears Frida's machine pick up.

                                  JENNIFER
                             (whispering)
                       Frida... pick up the phone...


        INT. SPENCER'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - NIGHT

        Spencer leads Frida to his bedroom. He turns on the lights. 
        Frida turns them back off. Spencer turns them back on.

                                  SPENCER
                       It's sexier with the lights on.

                                  FRIDA
                       I prefer the darkness.

        Spencer and Frida start taking off their clothes. Frida turns 
        off the lights before they're completely nude. Behind them, a 
        bit of light comes through the window.

        We hear them going at it.

                                  SPENCER
                       God, your nails are sharp.

        Frida laughs. Spencer flips on the light as they make out. 
        Frida turns the light off. 

                                  FRIDA
                       Is this all you have?
                                  SPENCER
                       Give it a few min... Oh yeah, 
                       nibble on my ear.

        Spencer flips on the lights again.

                                  SPENCER
                       The better to see you with.

        Frida turns them back off. We hear them going at it again.

                                  SPENCER
                       I love it when you bite me. Ouch, 
                       shit. Damn, that hurt.

        Spencer turns the light on. He gets a quick look at Frida -- 
        her eyes glow like wolf eyes. Frida turns the light off. 

        We hear Spencer freaking out and wolf-like growls and noises. 
        A vicious attack. From the darkness, we see the silhouette of 
        a human figure with wolf-like features get up from the bed and 
        walk off. Spencer is moaning.

        The room remains dark for a moment. Then Spencer struggles 
        and turns on the light. He's all bloodied and can barely move 
        as he reaches for the phone. As soon as he grabs the 
        receiver, he dies. The bloody phone falls to the floor.


        EXT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

        Peter and Lloyd are ringing Frida's buzzer. No answer. 

                                  LLOYD
                       I still don't get when you gave her 
                       back the pillowcase. 

                                  PETER
                       We only live a few blocks apart. 

                                  LLOYD
                       This is more than fishy, this chick 
                       dates a dude and he winds up dead.

                                  PETER
                       Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she 
                       killed them.

        Lloyd thinks for a second. He scratches his head.

                                  LLOYD
                       She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe 
                       she hired someone to kill them. 

                                  PETER
                       She's not a suspect. What is her 
                       motive? There's nothing, NOTHING 
                       connecting her to either crime 
                       except that she dated both guys.

                                  LLOYD
                       Sounds like you got a conflict of 
                       interest. 

                                  PETER
                       You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, 
                       she's not here. Let's check out 
                       her psycho ex.

        Peter and Lloyd walk away. Lloyd glances back at the 
        building.

                                  LLOYD
                       How do you know about her psycho 
                       ex?


        EXT. STREET - NIGHT

        We see Frida's POV as she runs through the streets. Quick 
        glimpses of her growling and panting. Shots of people on the 
        street who are looking at her, frightened. A little boy 
        stares at her as she passes.

                                  BOY
                       Wolf! Wolf!

        Montage culminates with a low angle shot of Frida's silhouette, 
        with wolflike features, howling in front of a full moon.


        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

        Frida's asleep, disheveled, with scratches all over her. The 
        phone's ringing. Frida stretches like a cat and gets up and 
        sleepily answers the phone.

                                  FRIDA
                       Hello?

                                  JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
                       Frida? I was worried to death 
                       about you. I've called you for two 
                       days. Where have you been?

                                  FRIDA
                       I've been here. What day is it?

                                  JENNIFER
                       Tuesday. Are you okay?

                                  FRIDA
                       Shit, I guess I missed work. 

                                  JENNIFER
                       Frida, Carlton's dead.

                                  FRIDA
                       Oh no. 

                                  JENNIFER
                       And he was missing an arm. 

                                  FRIDA
                       Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to 
                       confession.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No 
                       way could you have done that. 
                       Maybe you saw someone kill him and 
                       blocked it out... or...

        There's a knock on the door. Frida whispers into the phone.

                                  FRIDA
                             (whispering)
                       Someone's at my door. Maybe it's 
                       the cops. 

        More knocks and Frida hears Mark's voice behind the door.
                                  MARK (FROM THE HALLWAY)
                       Frida? I hear you talking. I know 
                       you're in there. Let me in.

                                  FRIDA
                             (whispering into phone)
                       It's Mark.

                                  JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
                       Get rid of him!

                                  FRIDA
                       Okay, I gotta go.

                                  JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
                       I'm stopping by later. I'm worried 
                       about you. Bye.

        Frida hangs up the phone.

                                  MARK (FROM THE HALLWAY)
                       It's a matter of life and death.

                                  FRIDA
        This really isn't a good time.

                                  MARK (FROM THE HALLWAY)
                       Come on Frida, I'm not kidding. 
                       I'm totally fucked. Let me in.

        He bangs loudly on the door. Frida opens it and he barges in.

                                  MARK
                       I did something stupid. I had a 
                       courier job -- picking up a package 
                       from the airport. It turned out to 
                       be money -- so I kind of borrowed 
                       it to pay my rent and now these 
                       dudes are after me.

                                  FRIDA
                       So pay them back and apologize.

                                  MARK
                       These guys aren't the kind that'll 
                       take an apology. They're the kind 
                       that'll break my thumbs.

                                  FRIDA
                       You think that story's gonna make 
                       me loan you money?

                                  MARK
                       It's the truth. If you'd just 
                       loaned me the money last time this 
                       never would have happened.

                                  FRIDA
                       Somehow this winds up being my 
                       fault? You always blame me.

                                  MARK
                       Come on, I'm your biggest 
                       supporter.

                                  FRIDA
                       My bra is my biggest supporter.

                                  MARK
                       I just need a place to lay low for 
                       a few days. Come on, I know you 
                       hate me but you can't wanna see me 
                       at the bottom of the East River?

        Mark looks up at her with his pleading Bambi eyes that Frida 
        always falls for.

        Mark goes to hug her and kiss her neck. She sniffs him. Then 
        sniffs him again more closely -- like a dog. Mark giggles. 
        Frida doesn't like what she smells.

                                  MARK
                       Do I smell? Can I take a shower?

        He lifts his arms and sniffs his armpits.

                                  FRIDA
                       I'm not feeling too well all of the 
                       sudden. Go take your shower.


        INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - DUSK	88

        Mark puts his wallet, watch and beeper on the dresser and 
        leaves the room, unbuttoning his shirt. Frida enters and sits 
        on the bed. Her head is spinning. Mark turns on the shower, 
        which we hear off screen. He passes in front of the camera, 
        shirtless. Frida sees him, gets up and walks toward him.

                                  FRIDA
                       Mark.

                                  MARK
                       Yeah?

        He comes back into frame. Frida grabs him and kisses him on 
        the mouth. He's taken off guard. She then pushes him away.

                                  MARK
                       Wow.

                                  FRIDA
                       Take your shower.

        Mark leaves frame. Frida goes back into the bedroom. She 
        hears Mark singing, muffled from the bathroom. Frida's about 
        to lie back on the bed when Mark's beeper goes off.

        She reaches up to the dresser for the beeper. It's the kind 
        that has a message on it. She presses the message button and 
        sees, "Mark you studmuffin, last night was awesome. See you 
        soon. Sherry." Frida puts down the beeper.

        She leans back on the bed and stares up at the ceiling. Her 
        eyes are glowing. 


        INT. FRIDA'S BATHROOM - DUSK

        Mark steps in the shower and pulls the shower curtain closed. 
        CU of the water coming out of the spout. Mark suds his body 
        with soap and continues singing. He starts even lightly 
        dancing in the shower -- looking vain and ridiculous.

        A blurry human figure with wolf-like features appears behind 
        the shower curtain -- but Mark has his back turned and doesn't 
        see it. Then he hears a growl over the sound of the water 
        running. Mark turns around and sees the figure.

        Then we see from the wolf-figure's POV an attack on Mark. 
        Reminiscent of the shower scene from "Psycho." 

        After the attack, the blurry, wolfish figure runs off, and the 
        camera stays on Mark as he slumps to the ground. We zoom in 
        on his eye and on the bloody water going down the drain. 
        Dissolve from the eye to a full moon and then back to the eye.


        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Camera dollies creepily through the apartment as we still hear 
        the sound of the water running in the shower.

        FADE TO BLACK.


        INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

        A knocking at the door awakens Frida. She is nearly naked 
        except for some shredded clothing. Her face is scratched. 
        She moves her mouth as though she has a bad taste in it. She 
        blinks a few times and her vision seems blurry. 

        She sits up, puts her glasses on, throws on her robe and 
        stumbles to answer the door. The shower water is still 
        running, but Frida doesn't seem to notice. 


        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - MORNING

        Frida opens the door and Jennifer walks in. Frida looks 
        really out of it, and there's blood on the front of her.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Shit what happened to you? What's 
                       all over you?

        Frida looks down at her chest and sees blood.

                                  FRIDA
                       Holy shit, I don't know.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Did you get rid of Mark? 

                                  FRIDA
                       I don't know... I'm spaced out... 
                       he was taking a shower... He must 
                       be still in there.

                                  JENNIFER
                       He's been here all night?

                                  FRIDA
                       Yeah, I guess. Mark?

        Frida heads for the bathroom and Jennifer follows.


        INT. FRIDA'S BATHROOM/HALLWAY - DAY

        Frida and Jennifer are near the bathroom and see a trickle of 
        blood on the edge of the white bathroom tiles.

                                  FRIDA
                       Oh my god.

        They inch closer to the bathroom and see Mark lying dead and 
        bloody, holding onto the shower curtain. Blood is all over 
        the white tiles. Frida flinches and spins out of the bathroom 
        and covers her eyes. Jennifer just stares at Mark. 

                                  JENNIFER
                       Frida, we need to talk.

        Frida takes a deep breath and peeks back into the bathroom.

                                  FRIDA
                       Oh god, did I do that?

        Jennifer stares at the bloody mess that was Mark.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Let's get him into the bathtub.

        Frida and Jennifer pick up the still bleeding Mark to lug him 
        back into the shower/bathtub.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Okay, so tell me again about that 
                       werewolf thing...


        INT. FRIDA'S BATHROOM - DAY

        The dead Mark sits propped up in the bathtub. Jennifer and 
        Frida are on their hands and knees with scrub brushes and 
        soap, cleaning the bathroom floor.

                                  JENNIFER
                       If there's gonna be a bloody mess, 
                       at least it's in the bathtub. 
                       We'll just hose him off till the 
                       blood runs out.

        Frida and Jennifer look at Mark. He's missing a tooth.

                                  JENNIFER
                       What happened to his tooth?

                                  FRIDA
                       I should call the police. Oh no 
                       Peter. Peter is the police!

                                  JENNIFER
                       DON'T call the police.

                                  FRIDA
                       Why not? There's been a murder.

                                  JENNIFER
                       First of all, you're my alibi. I 
                       told George I was with you last 
                       night.

                                  FRIDA
                       What? Why'd you do that?

                                  JENNIFER
                       There's kind of this guy I'm 
                       seeing.

                                  FRIDA
                       You're cheating on George? 
                       Jennifer, how could you?

        Jennifer looks over at Mark in the tub.

                                  JENNIFER
                       How could I? I'm helping you clean 
                       up Mark's remains and you ask how 
                       could I cheat on George?

                                  FRIDA
                       You're right. It's just, I can't 
                       cover up a murder so George won't 
                       know you're cheating.

                                  JENNIFER
                       You say murder, but you have no 
                       idea what happened. You don't 
                       remember doing it, so it's out of 
                       your control.

                                  FRIDA
                       I think I turned into a werewolf 
                       and killed him.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Why the fuck would you do that?

                                  FRIDA
                       I could smell another woman on him. 

                                  JENNIFER
                       If you ask me, the fucker got what 
                       he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.

                                  FRIDA
                       That's a terrible thing to say.
                       Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Okay, let's say that this is PMS-
                       related. You think those male cops 
                       are going to understand that? 
                       You'll either be locked up for 
                       murder or locked up in the looney 
                       bin. We have to keep this hidden 
                       until we figure it out ourselves.


        INT. POLICE CAR - DAY 95

        Peter's driving with Lloyd in the passenger seat.


                                  LLOYD
                       Nah, East Village poseur was 
                       grosser than the dude in the park.

                                  PETER
                       The park dude was missing an arm.

                                  LLOYD
                       Poseur was missing a chunk of his 
                       neck. And his eyes were open. 
                       That always bugs me out. Do me a 
                       favor, if some mutherfucker's about 
                       to blow me away, remind me to close 
                       my fuckin' eyes.

                                  PETER
                       Deal. And if some mutherfucker's 
                       about to blow me away, shoot him.

                                  LLOYD
                       Yeah okay. I still say Frida's 
                       involved. She's the last one to 
                       see two dudes alive...

                                  PETER
                       She wasn't the last one to see them 
                       alive. Whoever killed them was. 


        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

        Frida and Jennifer have Mark in a bag in the kitchen. 

                                  JENNIFER
                       At least I finally saw the reason 
                       you couldn't get over Mark.

                                  FRIDA
                       You should have seen it erect.

        They hear the intercom buzzer and stare at each other.

                                  JENNIFER
                       You expecting someone?

                                  FRIDA
                       No.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Ignore it.

        The buzzer keeps buzzing. Frida goes to the window and looks 
        down to the street. Just as she does, outside, Peter and 
        Lloyd step back from the building and look up at Frida in the 
        window. Peter smiles and waves. Frida forces a smile and 
        waves back. Then she ducks back away from the window.

                                  FRIDA
                       Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, 
                       now I have to let him in.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Tell them you'll meet them outside.

        Frida goes to the intercom and presses it.

                                  FRIDA
                       Uh.... hi!

                                  PETER
                       Frida, can we come in? We need to 
                       talk to you. It's important.

                                  FRIDA
                       Uh... the buzzer's broken. I'll be 
                       down in a second.

        She releases the intercom buzzer.

                                  FRIDA
                       What the fuck are we going to do?

                                  JENNIFER
                       Hide him.

        Frida and Jennifer both look around the small apartment.

                                  FRIDA
                       The refrigerator.

        She opens the refrigerator and starts taking everything out. 
        Jennifer helps her. They drag Mark's body over.

                                  FRIDA
                       Go downstairs and stall them.

        Jennifer goes.


        INT./EXT. FRIDA'S BUILDING/ENTRYWAY - DAY

        Jennifer walks toward Peter and Lloyd, who are standing 
        outside and can see her through the glass door. She swings 
        her hips as she walks and puts on a flirtatious smile. She 
        opens the door and stands in it -- blocking their entrance.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Hi guys. What's up? 

        Lloyd is especially happy to see Jennifer.


        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

        Frida has Mark shoved in the refrigerator and is closing the 
        door. She frantically puts the former contents of the 
        refrigerator into cupboards. 


        INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

        Jennifer, Peter and Lloyd are in the elevator. The doors are 
        about to close when Jennifer sticks her hand between them and 
        pokes her head out into the hall.

                                  JENNIFER
                       I thought I heard someone coming. 

        She gets back in the elevator and the doors close. She pushes 
        the button for the fourth floor.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Oh shit, wrong floor.

        She pushes the button for the fifth floor. The cops eye her 
        suspiciously. She smiles as the elevator doors close.

                                  JENNIFER
                       I was thinking about becoming a cop 
                       myself. Do you take a test or 
                       something or just sign up?

                                  PETER
                       Why would you want to be a cop?

                                  JENNIFER
                       I don't know, I guess the outfits 
                       are cool. And I want a big gun.

        She winks at Lloyd who smiles back at her.


        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

        Frida is shoving Mark's clothes in the freezer. She hears a 
        knock on the door and Jennifer's voice.

                                  JENNIFER (FROM THE HALLWAY)
                       Frida? It's us... Jennifer and the 
                       nice detectives.

        Frida takes a last look around, tries to compose herself, and 
        lets them in.

                                  FRIDA
                       Hi guys! What's up?

        Peter, Lloyd and Jennifer walk in. Jennifer looks around, 
        making sure Frida didn't forget anything.

                                  PETER
                       We need to ask you a few questions. 

        There's a weird tension between Peter and Frida. He hates 
        having to ask her these questions.

                                  LLOYD
                       You heard about Carlton Fraser?

                                  FRIDA
                       Yes, Jennifer told me. What does 
                       that have to do with me?

                                  PETER
                       You had a date with Carlton?

                                  FRIDA
                       It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited 
                       me along to dinner with them.

                                  LLOYD
                       Seems you were the last to see 
                       Carlton alive. And the last to see 
                       Gregory alive.

                                  FRIDA
                       What makes you think I was the last 
                       one?

                                  PETER
                       He means the last that we know of.

                                  LLOYD
                       This one walk you home too?

                                  FRIDA
                       No. We left the restaurant, and... 
                       and I felt sick... so... so I took 
                       a cab home. Alone.

                                  LLOYD
                       You got a dog?

                                  FRIDA
                       No, I have a cat.

                                  LLOYD
                       How big?

        Lloyd looks around. He starts coughing -- like he's choking 
        on something.

                                  PETER
                       You okay Lloyd?

        Lloyd tries to nod his head "yes" but keeps coughing.

                                  PETER
                       He needs some water. 

        Peter opens the cupboard to get a glass and sees a carton of 
        milk, some cottage cheese, other products that should be in 
        the refrigerator. Lloyd is not facing the cupboard and is in 
        his coughing fit anyway, so he doesn't see this. 

        Peter turns to look at the refrigerator and then looks at 
        Jennifer and Frida. He makes eye-contact with Frida and sees 
        she's afraid. He lets her off the hook and just takes a glass 
        out of the cupboard and closes it as though nothing's wrong. 

        He fills the glass with water from the sink and hands it to 
        Lloyd. Lloyd drinks up and stops his coughing fit.

                                  PETER
                       We're considering Mark Wilson a 
                       suspect.

        Frida gulps.

                                  LLOYD
                       He's got a record. Drug charges. 
                       Avoided jail on pleas. Plus a 
                       woman four years ago had a 
                       restraining order against him.

        Frida is genuinely surprised by all this.

                                  JENNIFER
                       See he was cheating from the get 
                       go.

                                  PETER
                       He's been running money for the 
                       Mafia.

                                  FRIDA
                       No he's not. He's a courier. He 
                       picks up packages from the airport.

                                  LLOYD
                       Packages of money.

                                  PETER
                       Seems he's stolen money from them. 
                       He's desperate and our only lead.

                                  LLOYD
                       One of our only leads... You had 
                       dates with both men right before 
                       they were killed. 

                                  FRIDA
                       Am I a suspect?

        Lloyd looks at Peter.

                                  PETER
                       No, no... But Mark -- a jealous 
                       boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills 
                       men you date.

                                  FRIDA
                       Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Frida, you have to admit, he is a 
                       bit cold at times. And last time 
                       you saw him, he was quite torn 
                       apart.

        Jennifer is tempted to laugh. Frida is more serious.

                                  FRIDA
                       But you said the bodies were ripped 
                       to pieces?

                                  PETER
                       Still haven't figured out how he or 
                       anyone else pulled that off. Never 
                       seen anything like it.

        Frida sees some water leaking from her cupboard. She's 
        increasingly nervous.

                                  LLOYD
                       Do you know Spencer Hale? East 
                       Village musician?

        Frida shakes her head no. She looks confused.

                                  FRIDA
                       No, why?

                                  PETER
                       He was ripped to shreds also. In 
                       his apartment.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Mark's an East Village musician. 
                       He probably knows Spencer. 

                                  LLOYD
                       Interesting. We'll have to check 
                       that out.

        Peter and Lloyd head for the door. 

                                  PETER
                       This is probably the strangest case 
                       we've ever seen.

        Frida lets them out. She and Peter exchange a glance. Frida 
        closes the door. She and Jennifer stare at each other.

                                  FRIDA
                             (whispering)
                       Peter knows something.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Well if he does, he didn't give you 
                       away. He must really like you.


        INT. PETER'S CAR - DAY

        Peter and Lloyd driving.

                                  PETER
                       Spencer's the key here. Frida is 
                       in no way associated with him. And 
                       her blood hasn't matched with any 
                       of the killings.

                                  LLOYD
                       It's a bit farfetched that Mark 
                       would rip guys to shreds just outta 
                       jealousy. This makes no sense. 

                                  PETER
                       It's like some fucking monster 
                       dropped out of the sky and killed 
                       these dudes. 

                                  LLOYD
                       Like a vampire or some shit?

        Lloyd looks skeptically at Peter.


        EXT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

        Frida and Jennifer haul Mark's body into the trunk of his car. 

                                  FRIDA
                       Jesus Christ what are we gonna do? 
                       We can't bury him around here. 

        Both women pace.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Okay, we put him in his car trunk. 
                       We drive it to a "No Parking" area 
                       where we know it'll be towed. The 
                       tow truck will come and take it to 
                       a huge lot. No one's gonna claim 
                       it. It'll sit there for a long 
                       time. By the time anyone discovers 
                       a body in it, it'll be all 
                       decomposed and we'll have thought 
                       of better alibis by then.


        INT./EXT. MARK'S CAR - DAY

        Frida is driving Mark's car -- she wears gloves. Jennifer, 
        also wearing gloves, sits in the passenger seat. Both also 
        wear dark sunglasses.


        EXT. "NO PARKING" AREA - DAY

        Frida and Jennifer leave the car in the "No Parking" area. 
        They cross the street and head up the street.

                                  FRIDA
                       I think I just got my period.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Does that mean this whole thing is 
                       over?

                                  FRIDA
                       Probably for three weeks or so 
                       anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't 
                       get how it works. 

                                  JENNIFER
                       Let's do some research. I'll check 
                       the libraries. You surf the web.

                                  FRIDA
                       You're such a good friend.

                                  JENNIFER
                       So are you. Look, go about your 
                       life. Act like nothing's wrong. 
                       We'll get to the bottom of this.

        Jennifer gives Frida a hug and heads off the other way.


        INT. OFFICE - DAY

        Frida is totally buried in scripts at work now. The phone 
        keeps ringing, but she lets it go to voicemail. She's reading 
        a werewolf book.

        Mr. Grant walks by.

                                  FRIDA
                       Mr. Grant. Did you read that 
                       script I was talking about?

                                  MR. GRANT
                       Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman 
                       in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn 
                       Medicine Woman. Find me a true 
                       story about a crazed killer 
                       stalking beautiful women.

                                  FRIDA
                       No. 

                                  MR. GRANT
                       No?

                                  FRIDA
                       No. I quit. Take your lame ass 
                       ideas, your fake ass toupee, your 
                       fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids 
                       and shove them.

                                  MR. GRANT
                       Very well then. Is that all?

        He continues walking as though nothing's happened. Frida 
        starts packing up her things.


        EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

        Frida comes out of the building carrying a box full of 
        personal items from her desk. She runs into Peter. 

                                  PETER
                       Frida. I was looking for you. You 
                       changing jobs?

                                  FRIDA
                       Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?

                                  PETER
                       I need to talk to you. About us. 
                       Frida... I... Can I carry your box?

                                  FRIDA
                       No, I got it. It's okay.

                                  PETER
                       What happened?

        Frida gulps. She's nervous.

                                  FRIDA
                       What happened?

                                  PETER
                       I thought we were starting 
                       something... and then... I know 
                       it's unorthodox, I mean with you 
                       being involved in the case and all.

                                  FRIDA
                       I just don't know if I should be 
                       dating anyone right now. 

                                  PETER
                       Yeah, every guy you date winds up 
                       dead.

        Frida stops walking.

                                  PETER
                       Except Mark of course.

                                  FRIDA
                       What's that supposed to mean?

                                  PETER
                       Did I tell you I have the worst 
                       sense of humor and I make bad jokes 
                       at totally inappropriate times?

                                  FRIDA
                       No, but thanks for the warning.

                                  PETER
                       Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to 
                       track him down and there's no sight 
                       of him. Vanished into thin air. I 
                       got a hunch he fled the country.

                                  FRIDA
                       Interesting possibility.

        They're near the subway entrance.

                                  PETER
                       Lemme give you a ride. You can't 
                       take the subway with that box.


        INT. PETER'S CAR - DAY

        Peter's driving; Frida's in the passenger seat. We don't hear 
        the dialog but just see them laughing and having a good time. 
        Making eye contact from time to time.


        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

        Frida is surfing the web. Jennifer looks over her shoulder. 
        She finds a page with PMS symptoms.

                                  JENNIFER
                             (reading from screen)
                       Symptoms include loss of emotional 
                       control, compulsive behavior, 
                       cravings, crying spells... 

                                  FRIDA
                       Peter keeps asking me out.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Maybe you should go out with him. 
                       If you keep avoiding him he'll get 
                       suspicious. Besides, what better 
                       way to not get busted than to date 
                       the cop who's investigating you.

                                  FRIDA
                       The thing is, I really like him. I 
                       finally meet a guy I really like 
                       and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.

                                  JENNIFER
                       We don't know you're a werewolf. 
                       It might never happen again. You 
                       have to get on with your life.


        EXT. ZOO - DAY

        Frida and Peter walking through the zoo. Animals start 
        reacting strangely to Frida. 

        They look at the wolf cages. The wolves stare at Frida. She 
        runs off. Peter chases after her.


        EXT. ZOO - DAY

        Frida runs out of the zoo with Peter behind her.

                                  PETER
                       Frida, wait. I thought you were an 
                       animal person.

        Peter catches up to her.

                                  FRIDA
                       I don't know what came over me. 

        They walk for a bit.

                                  FRIDA
                       I need to tell you something. It's 
                       about... PMS. I get it real bad.

        Peter laughs.

                                  PETER
                       That's it? Hell my mom chased my 
                       dad around with a knife when she 
                       had it. She made us call her a 
                       different name. She'd say, "You're 
                       talking to Betty now" and we'd 
                       leave the house for a few days.

                                  FRIDA
                       This is a lot worse than "Betty." 

                                  PETER
                       You can't mean that. I'm sure your 
                       bark is worse than your bite.

                                  FRIDA
                       No, my bite's a lot worse.

        Peter stops walking. Frida stops as well. Peter caresses the 
        side of Frida's face.

                                  PETER
                       Whatever it is, we can work it out. 
                       Frida, I love you.

        Frida's eyes well up. She doesn't know whether to laugh or 
        cry. She ends up laughing.

                                  PETER
                       Is it that funny?

                                  FRIDA
                       No, it's just... no one's ever said 
                       that. And I thought if someone did 
                       ever say it, I'd have to say it 
                       first and then they'd sort of say 
                       "I love you too" cause they felt 
                       they had to after I'd said it.

                                  PETER
                       Is that how you feel? 

                                  FRIDA
                       Like I had to say it? No, I wanted 
                       to say it.

                                  PETER
                       You didn't say it.

                                  FRIDA
                       I love you too.

        They kiss.


        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Frida is opening a bottle of champagne while Peter looks in 
        the cupboards for glasses. He finds some squirt guns.

                                  PETER
                       What's with the squirt guns?

                                  FRIDA
                       They're for my cat. I use them to 
                       train him not to rip up paper.

                                  PETER
                       You know, I've never seen your cat.

                                  FRIDA
                       I loaned him to Jennifer. George 
                       moved out and she was lonely...

        Peter takes a squirt gun and squirts Frida. Frida screams 
        playfully. She grabs another squirt gun and fills it.

        MONTAGE of squirt gun fight. Played just like a "real" police 
        gunfight -- with them creeping through the apartment and 
        ducking behind furniture, trying to get a direct hit on each 
        other. And having a great time.

        Peter's beeper goes off. He checks it. As he does, Frida 
        squirts him in the face. She cracks up.

                                  FRIDA
                       Whatever you do, don't tell me you 
                       have to leave.

        Peter heads for the door.

                                  PETER
                       Okay. I won't tell you.

        She walks him to the door. They kiss. Peter opens the door. 
        From the hallway, we see his POV of Frida as he closes the 
        door and she looks sadly at him.

        MATCH CUT the closing of the door with the opening of the 
        trunk in the next scene.


        EXT. CAR LOT - DAY

        From inside the trunk, the door opens and we see Peter and 
        Lloyd looking down into it. They hold their noses from a bad 
        smell.

                                  LLOYD
                       You think mafia hit? 

                                  PETER
                       Hard to tell. Looks like he's been 
                       cleaned up and he's decomposing as 
                       we speak. This case gets weirder 
                       by the minute.

                                  LLOYD
                       It has to be Frida. This makes 
                       three guys ripped apart who are 
                       tied to her ass.

                                  PETER
                       Okay Lloyd. First, no way does 
                       Frida have the physical strength to 
                       tear a guy to shreds. Second, why 
                       would she be so obvious and let it 
                       be known she was the last one to 
                       see these guys? Third, she's the 
                       one in danger. She's a woman in 
                       jeopardy and you're layin' a murder 
                       rap on her. Fourth, I look in her 
                       eyes and know she's no killer.

                                  LLOYD
                       And fifth, you're dating her.

        Peter looks shocked. 

                                  PETER
                       What are you talking about?

                                  LLOYD
                       I know. I followed you. To the 
                       zoo, to her house, to your house...

                                  PETER
                       What the fuck are you following me 
                       for? I'm not a suspect here.

                                  LLOYD
                       Which brings up an interesting 
                       point. I wasn't following you. I 
                       was following the suspect. And you 
                       just happened to be there...


        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

        Jennifer is going through a stack of books on the sofa. 
        Frida's reading a magazine article on PMS. The apartment is 
        filled with werewolf research -- movies, books, articles.

                                  FRIDA
                             (reading aloud)
                       "Paranoia, insecurity, depression, 
                       changes in vision, feelings of 
                       losing control; belief that you 
                       have a mental problem..." Nothing 
                       about turning into a werewolf.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Check out what I found.

        Jennifer gets a very old-looking book out of her bag.

                                  JENNIFER
                       I found it in this out-of-the-way 
                       used bookstore. 

        Jennifer opens it up to a page she marked and reads aloud.

                                  JENNIFER
                       This is from a scientist in France, 
                       Madame Sconce. "The original 
                       werewolves were females. They 
                       became werewolves on the lunar 
                       cycle because it corresponded to 
                       the woman's cycle. My suspicion is 
                       that the only cure is true love."

                                  FRIDA
                       Great so all I have to do is fall 
                       in love? Like I haven't tried that 
                       for the past 24 years.

                                  JENNIFER
                             (continuing to read)
                       "The female-cycle werewolf will 
                       only kill men and never kills 
                       someone she truly loves." See I 
                       knew you never loved Mark.

                                  FRIDA
                       Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's 
                       find her and talk to her.

                                  JENNIFER
                       She died at age 34 in the 1800's. 
                       They thought she was crazy. She 
                       was banished from her town. Seems 
                       her husband shot her. 

                                  FRIDA
                       Guess she never found true love.

                                  JENNIFER
                       The weird thing is... he shot her 
                       with a silver bullet.

                                  FRIDA
                       So... she was a werewolf. Do you 
                       think we can believe all this?

                                  JENNIFER
                       What choice do we have? 

                                  FRIDA
                       So what do I do?

                                  JENNIFER
                       Fall in love.

                                  FRIDA
                       I think I already have.


        EXT. SKY - NIGHT

        A nearly full moon. A dark cloud passes over it.


        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - DAY

        Dolly through the apartment. We hear the sounds of Frida and 
        Peter making love. Move in on the bedroom as they're 
        finishing. Peter gets behind Frida to cuddle. He cups his 
        hands around her breasts. 

                                  PETER
                       Your breasts feel larger.

                                  FRIDA
                       They do? Oh no...

                                  PETER
                       No, it's a good thing. I like it. 
                       Everything about you is great. I 
                       like how you don't shave your legs. 
                       Women are so much sexier when 
                       they're natural.

        Frida sits up.

                                  FRIDA
                       I did shave... Do I seem hairy?
                       Peter laughs.

                                  PETER
                       No. But I don't mind hairy. Are 
                       you okay?

        Frida nearly flies out of bed, grabbing whatever she can find 
        to cover herself up.

                                  FRIDA
                       I... I should just get up. I have 
                       lots to do today...

        Peter stares at her strangely as she darts out of the room.


        INT. FRIDA'S BATHROOM - DAY

        Peter is peeing.


        INT. FRIDA'S KITCHEN - DAY

        Frida's furiously cutting her nails which are strangely long.


        INT. FRIDA'S BATHROOM - DAY

        As Peter pees, he notices something small and white on the 
        floor. He tries to reach it but can't till he finishes 
        peeing. Finally he's done. He bends down and picks up the 
        object, which is a large front tooth. Peter has a quick flash 
        of Mark's dead face in the car trunk. Missing a tooth.


        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT/KITCHEN - DAY

        Frida notices her long nails and thinks she sees tufts of hair 
        on her hands. She hears Peter coming and quickly slips on 
        some rubber gloves to hide her hands.

        ECU of Peter sticking the tooth in his pants pocket. He 
        enters the kitchen. Something's weighing heavily on his mind. 

                                  PETER
                       I gotta get downtown.

        He goes to her to kiss her, but Frida, self-conscious about 
        possible facial hair, bows her head and he ends up kissing the 
        top of it. She recoils and he looks at her, concerned. She 
        won't let him get a good look at her face.

                                  FRIDA
                       I have... a lot of... cleaning to 
                       do today.

        She turns around. Peter shrugs. He knows something's wrong. 
        He heads for the door.

                                  PETER
                       I'll call you later.

        Frida nods. Peter leaves. Once he does, Frida rushes to the 
        calendar on the wall and into an ECU of her eye (at edge of 
        frame). ECU calendar -- panning past Monday, Tuesday, etc. 
        until we see in red ink "the curse."

        DOLLY IN/ZOOM OUT of Frida's face, reacting.


        EXT. STREET - DAY

        Peter takes the tooth out of his pocket and examines it. He 
        looks around, sees no one and throws it down a sewer grating.


        INT. CHURCH/CONFESSIONAL - DAY

        Frida in one side of the confessional; a PRIEST in the other.

                                  FRIDA
                       I was just wondering... a person 
                       has a choice between killing 
                       themselves or killing others, which 
                       is worse? I mean you fry in hell 
                       either way, right?

                                  PRIEST
                       If you kill yourself, you won't be 
                       around to ask for forgiveness or to 
                       make a last confession, whereas if 
                       you kill others, you can go to 
                       confession, do penance, and be 
                       absolved from your sins.

                                  FRIDA
                       But if the person is killing 
                       several people, then maybe it's 
                       better to kill oneself cause then 
                       the killing stops.

                                  PRIEST
                       You have a point. Hmmm... I've 
                       never been asked this before... 
                       Who is being killed? Catholics? 
                       Homosexuals? Protestants?


        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

        Frida runs into the room to grab her Midol. She downs some 
        and runs into the bathroom -- searches the medicine cabinet 
        for pills. Finds nothing.

        She looks at herself in the mirror. She has the strange wolf 
        eyes, nails and teeth.


        INT. PETER'S OFFICE - DAY

        Peter is looking at a photo of the crime scene in Spencer's 
        apartment. He notices Spencer wearing a Los Lobos T-shirt. 
        Peter's troubled by it.


        INT. FRIDA'S KITCHEN - DAY

        Frida finds a large knife and practices stabbing herself. She 
        tries to slit her wrists but can't. She screams.

                                  FRIDA
                       Ugh! I can't even kill myself!!

        MONTAGE of Frida trying to kill herself.

        Frida's on the phone with the yellow pages in her lap.

                                  FRIDA
                       Yes silver bullets. Do you have 
                       any silver bullets? I only need a 
                       few. No this is not a joke... 

        Frida hears a dial tone. 


        EXT. BUILDING ROOF - DAY

        Frida is walking near the edge of a roof, looking like she's 
        preparing to jump. CU of her feet as she leaps out of frame.

                                                         CUT TO:

        INT. FRIDA'S KITCHEN - DAY

        Frida's feet land in frame as though she had jumped here from 
        the rooftop shot. She lands in a squat and is picking up 
        spilled chocolate chips from the floor and eating them.

                                                         CUT TO:

        A knock on Frida's door. Frida has her head in the oven. We 
        just see Frida's back half sticking out of the stove. She 
        doesn't answer the door. The knocking continues.

                                  JENNIFER (FROM HALLWAY)
                       Frida? You there? Remember, you 
                       gave me a key for emergencies? I 
                       consider this an emergency.

        Jennifer uses her key and barges in. She looks around and 
        sees Frida sticking out of the stove. 

                                  JENNIFER
                       Oh god Frida, don't do it!

        She pulls her out and Frida has rubber gloves on and is 
        holding a SOS pad.

                                  FRIDA
                       I'm cleaning my stove.

                                  JENNIFER
                       You scared the shit out of me. I 
                       thought you were killing yourself.

                                  FRIDA
                       I tried to kill myself -- earlier. 
                       It doesn't work. I think I need 
                       silver bullets. So I got depressed 
                       and when I'm depressed I clean.

                                  JENNIFER
                       You'll get through this. You were 
                       fine for over three weeks.

                                  FRIDA
                       I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I 
                       think I love him.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Remember what Madame Sconce said. 
                       If you love him he'll be fine.

                                  FRIDA
                       But how do I know if I really love 
                       Peter? And if he really loves me?

                                  JENNIFER
                       I guess you'll find out.

                                  FRIDA
                       No. I can't take that chance. I'd 
                       rather kill myself.

                                  JENNIFER
                       No. I won't let you do that.

                                  FRIDA
                       The werewolf always dies at the 
                       end. Didn't you see "American 
                       Werewolf in London?"


        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

        Jennifer and Frida are nailing boards onto the windows to 
        barricade Frida inside. They have put out tons of raw steak 
        and chocolate bars on large plates near the sofa.

                                  JENNIFER
                       I think George knows.

                                  FRIDA
                       About Mark? Carlton?

                                  JENNIFER
                       About Benito.

                                  FRIDA
                       Did I kill a guy named Benito?

                                  JENNIFER
                       No, he's the guy I'm having an 
                       affair with.

        They're done barricading the window. Jennifer picks up some 
        more wood and nails.

                                  FRIDA
                       I thought you and George were 
                       getting married. 

                                  JENNIFER
                       We were -- I was just so tempted... 
                       It was sort of a test. I think 
                       after sleeping with Benito I know I 
                       want to be with George. But now 
                       George knows about Benito and he 
                       doesn't want to be with me!

                                  FRIDA
                       I wish I only had your problems.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about 
                       myself at a time like this. Are 
                       you sure you're going to be okay?

                                  FRIDA
                       Yes, just check on me once a day 
                       for the next three days. Then the 
                       PMS should be over.

        Jennifer hands Frida the wood and nails.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Okay, just nail shut this door 
                       behind me. I'll call you later.

        Frida looks worried.

                                  FRIDA
                       I don't deserve a friend like you.

        Jennifer leans in and kisses Frida on the cheek.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Yes you do.

        Jennifer smiles and leaves. After she closes the door, Frida 
        immediately starts nailing boards across the door to shut 
        herself in.


        INT. PETER'S OFFICE - DAY

        Peter dials the phone.


        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

        Frida is resting on the sofa. The door is boarded shut. The 
        phone rings and Frida picks it up.

                                  FRIDA
                       Hello?

                                  PETER (ON PHONE)
                       Frida? You okay? Look, I think I 
                       know what happened to Mark. I want 
                       to help. I'm coming over.

                                  FRIDA
                       NO! Don't come over. Peter... 
                       I... I don't want to see you 
                       anymore. Ever.

                                  PETER (ON PHONE)
                       What? Is there someone else?

        Frida hesitates for a moment.


        INT. PETER'S OFFICE - DAY

        Peter looks really depressed on the phone. 

                                  FRIDA (ON PHONE)
                       Yes, sort of. I mean no, not 
                       really.

                                  PETER
                       Yes or no? Frida, can't you just 
                       be honest with me?


        BACK TO FRIDA'S APARTMENT

        Long pause as they each try to think of something to say.

                                  PETER (ON PHONE)
                       You at least owe me the truth.

                                  FRIDA
                       You want the truth? Remember I 
                       tried to tell you something the 
                       other day? 

                                  PETER (ON PHONE)
                       Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal 
                       with that.

                                  FRIDA
                       No you can't. It... it gets so bad 
                       that I become a werewolf.

        BACK TO PETER'S OFFICE

        Peter shakes his head.

                                  PETER
                       If you don't like me, just say so. 
                       You don't have to make up some 
                       bullshit like you're a werewolf.

                                  FRIDA (ON PHONE)
                       I knew you wouldn't believe me! 
                       Just go away. Go very far away!

        Peter hears a hang up. He puts the phone down and stares at 
        it sadly for a moment.


        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - EVENING (DUSK)

        Frida is crying. She takes the phone off the hook.


        INT. PETER'S OFFICE - EVENING (DUSK)

        Lloyd walks by Peter's door. Peter calls out to him. 

                                  PETER
                       Hey Lloyd.

        Lloyd stops and comes in the office.

                                  LLOYD
                       My girlfriend's predicting another 
                       murder in the next few days.

                                  PETER
                       What makes her think that?

                                  LLOYD
                       She says she's on the rag every 
                       time I get called in to investigate 
                       a murder.

        Something clicks with Peter. He flips through a calendar.

                                  PETER
                       So... they're on some cycle. The 
                       murders... Gregory... then 28 days 
                       later... Carlton. 

                                  LLOYD
                       And that was 28 days ago today.

                                  PETER
                       Did we get those DNA tests back?

                                  LLOYD
                       Just this morning. Animal hairs 
                       were found all over the victims. 

                                  PETER
                       What kind of animal?

                                  LLOYD
                       Can't figure out the species. 
                       Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' 
                       at the lab that a werewolf probably 
                       killed him. Ain't that the 
                       stupidest thing you ever heard?


        EXT. STREET - DUSK

        Peter walks through the streets, quickly, on a mission. He 
        takes a handful of silver bullets out of his pocket and looks 
        at them. He's wearing a red, hooded sweatshirt.


        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT/HALLWAY - DUSK*/

        Peter sees Frida's door open and broken wood and nails on the 
        floor. He walks into Frida's apartment. 

        The apartment is quiet, no sign of Frida. The plates that had 
        steak and chocolate on them are all empty now. Peter walks 
        around looking for her. He takes his gun out and peers around 
        the corner, expecting to find something. He hears something 
        and spins around facing the front door, pointing the gun.

        It's Frida. She stands at the front door with a side of beef 
        so big she can barely carry it. She gnaws at it. Her eyes 
        are glowing orange. She sees Peter and looks embarrassed.

                                  FRIDA
                       Go away. I might hurt you.

                                  PETER
                       I'm not afraid. Frida! I love 
                       you.

                                  FRIDA
                       Peter I love you too but...

                                  PETER
                       I don't think you'll hurt me. 

        Frida, still gnawing at the beef, circles him slowly. He's 
        scared but he lowers the gun.

                                  FRIDA
                       How do you know?

                                  PETER 
                       I don't think you would. No matter 
                       what form you take.

                                  FRIDA
                       I can't take that chance... I 
                       couldn't live with myself if I did 
                       anything to you.

                                  PETER 
                       I have the silver bullets in case I 
                       need to protect myself. Does that 
                       make you feel better?

        There is a long pause. 

                                  FRIDA
                       A little.

        Peter sets the gun on the table. He takes a few steps closer. 
        Frida backs up.

                                  FRIDA
                       Be careful!

                                  PETER
                       Can't you bite me and then I'll be 
                       like you?

                                  FRIDA
                       No. It doesn't work that way. Men 
                       can't get PMS. Unfortunately.

                                  PETER
                       I'm staying here with you tonight. 
                       There's no getting rid of me.

        He steps closer again and now Frida's backed up against the 
        wall. He can see her eyes look strangely wolf-like. He's 
        afraid but inches closer. Frida tries to inch away. It's 
        almost like a dance. Finally they find their way to each 
        other and embrace -- the side of beef between them.

                                  FRIDA
                       Promise to shoot me if I attack 
                       you.

        Peter closes his eyes and nods. Frida sniffs the side of beef 
        hungrily.

                                  FRIDA
                       Can you order up some chocolate?

        Peter smiles.


        EXT. SKY - NIGHT

        A full moon.


        INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

        Peter is sitting up in bed reading Madame Sconce's werewolf 
        book. Frida is beside him asleep. Peter looks at her and 
        strokes her hair.


        EXT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

        Same dolly in we've seen a few times.

        INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

        Frida's asleep in bed. Dolly the same as when she woke up 
        with the severed arm. Frida wakes up. She's afraid to look 
        behind her for fear she's killed Peter. All she sees is an 
        empty pillow. She looks under the sheets. Nothing -- just 
        pure white, no blood. Frida smiles and sighs in relief.

        From the next room, Frida hears whistling. Peter walks in 
        carrying a "breakfast in bed" tray. On the tray is a huge 
        rare steak and a red rose. Frida sits up.

        Peter brings the tray to her and places it on her lap. He 
        sits at the foot of the bed.

                                  PETER
                       I knew you wouldn't kill me.

                                  FRIDA
                       Maybe we should have children. I 
                       don't think I'd kill the father of 
                       my child.

                                  PETER
                       We can work this out. Other 
                       couples have worse problems.

                                  FRIDA
                       Worse than this?

                                  PETER
                       Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a 
                       little werewolf a few days a month? 
                       We can move out to the country 
                       where you can feed off deer.

                                  FRIDA
                       What about... those guys... I might 
                       have...

                                  PETER
                       No way can anything be proved. All 
                       they have are some wolf hairs. No 
                       one believes in werewolves.

                                  FRIDA
                       I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't 
                       help it. You know I didn't mean 
                       to... to do any of that.

                                  PETER
                       I know. The important thing is 
                       that it stop.

        Frida nods as she digs into her steak.


        INT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT - MORNING

        Jennifer is eating a chocolate bar. She looks sad and her face 
        is pale and makeup-less. She's headed for her door and opens 
        it to reveal George. He smiles sheepishly at her. She beams.

                                  JENNIFER
                       Truce?

        George pulls out a can of Readi-Whip from his bag.

                                  GEORGE
                       Truce. 

        George sneezes.


        INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

        Frida's still eating. Peter gets up and kisses her on the 
        cheek.

                                  PETER
                       I'm going to take a shower.

                                  FRIDA
                       Okay.

        He starts to walk out. Frida continues with her steak.

                                  FRIDA
                       Peter?

        Peter stops at the door and turns around.

                                  FRIDA
                       Thanks. For everything.

        Peter smiles and continues out of the room. 


        INT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT - MORNING

        Jennifer's dialing on her cordless phone. George is in the 
        background covering his crotch with the whipped cream.


        INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

        Frida's still in bed chowing down. We hear the shower running 
        in the background. The phone rings; Frida picks it up.

                                  FRIDA
                       Hello?

                                  JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
                       Frida? You okay?

                                  FRIDA
                       Never been better. Peter spent the 
                       night. I must really love him. 
                       He's still alive.

                                  JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
                       Oh thank god. Maybe this whole 
                       thing is really over.

                                  FRIDA
                       God I hope so. Hey can I call you 
                       later? Peter's still here. He's 
                       in the shower.

                                  JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
                       Sure. See ya.


        INT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT - MORNING

        Jennifer hangs up. Then suddenly something occurs to her.

                                  JENNIFER
                       In the shower?

        She looks worried. 


        INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT/BATHROOM - MORNING	146

        CU of the gun with silver bullets still on the table where 
        Peter left it the night before. We hear Peter in the shower 
        humming the tune from "Peter and the Wolf." The camera 
        dollies from the gun into the bathroom. It continues to dolly 
        in as before when Mark was in the shower. Danger seems 
        imminent... Peter hears Frida calling.

                                  FRIDA
                       Peter? Peter?

        Dolly in close on his face. Behind him, through the shower 
        curtain, we see the blurry figure of Frida. Peter's a bit 
        worried for a moment too. He pulls back the curtain so he can 
        see her. She's standing there holding a towel.

                                  FRIDA
                       Here's a towel.

                                  PETER
                       Thanks.

        The tension is broken. Peter's completely relieved. Frida 
        hangs the towel on the towel rack and leaves. Peter goes back 
        to soaping himself up.

                                  PETER
                       Hey Frida?

        Frida comes back into the bathroom.

                                  PETER
                       Wanna join me?

        Frida beams. She tosses off her robe and gets in the shower. 
        Frida and Peter kiss and suds each other up. 

                                  PETER
                       Want me to do your back?

        Frida turns around. Peter starts scrubbing her back. Frida 
        appears to be enjoying it -- though we can't see her face 
        because she has her head down.

                                  PETER
                       Doesn't this feel great?

        Frida nodes her head. She lifts it and we see her face. Her 
        eyes are glowing. She smiles and we see fangs. Freeze frame 
        on CU of her eyes.
